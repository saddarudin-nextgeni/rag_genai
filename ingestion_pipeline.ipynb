IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M\\nOS to be used in the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC).[19] For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M\\nclone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products which it branded as MS-DOS, although IBM\\nrebranded it to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS following the release of the\\nIBM PC in August 1981. IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, so other companies had to reverse\\nengineer it for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the\\noperating systems. Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor.[20][21]:\\u200a210\\u200a The\\ncompany expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as with a\\npublishing division named Microsoft Press.[10]:\\u200a232\\u200a Paul Allen resigned from Microsoft in 1983 after\\ndeveloping Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma.[22] Allen claimed in Idea Man: A Memoir by the co-founder of\\nMicrosoft that Gates wanted to dilute his share in the company when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin\\'s\\ndisease because he did not think that he was working hard enough.[23] Allen later invested in low-tech\\nsectors, sports teams, commercial real estate, neuroscience, private space flight, and more.[24]\\n\\n\\n\\n1985–1994: Windows and Office\\nMicrosoft released Windows 1.0 on November 20, 1985, as a\\ngraphical extension for MS-DOS,[10]:\\u200a242–243,\\u200a246\\u200a despite\\nhaving begun jointly developing OS/2 with IBM that\\nAugust.[25] Microsoft moved its headquarters from Bellevue\\nto Redmond, Washington, on February 26, 1986, and went\\npublic with an initial public offering (IPO) at the NASDAQ\\nexchange on March 13,[26] with the resulting rise in stock\\nmaking an estimated four billionaires and 12,000\\xa0millionaires\\nfrom Microsoft employees.[27] Microsoft released its version\\nof OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on Windows 1.0 was released on November\\nApril 2, 1987.[10] In 1990, the Federal Trade Commission 20, 1985, as the first version of the\\nexamined Microsoft for possible collusion due to the Windows line.\\npartnership with IBM, marking the beginning of more than a\\ndecade of legal clashes with the government.[28] :\\u200a243–244\\u200a\\n\\nMeanwhile, the company was at work on Microsoft Windows NT, which was heavily based on their copy\\nof the OS/2 code. It shipped on July 21, 1993, with a new modular kernel and the 32-bit Win32\\napplication programming interface (API), making it easier to port from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based)\\nWindows. Microsoft informed IBM of Windows NT, and the OS/2 partnership deteriorated.[29]\\n\\nIn 1990, Microsoft introduced the Microsoft Office suite which bundled separate applications such as\\nMicrosoft Word and Microsoft Excel.[10]:\\u200a301\\u200a On May 22, Microsoft launched Windows 3.0, featuring\\nstreamlined user interface graphics and improved protected mode capability for the Intel 386\\nprocessor,[30] and both Office and Windows became dominant in their respective areas.[31][32]\\n\\nOn July 27, 1994, the Department of Justice\\'s Antitrust Division filed a competitive impact statement that\\nsaid: \"Beginning in 1988 and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute\\nanti-competitive per processor licenses. Under a per-processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty\\nfor each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer\\nwith a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to\\nMicrosoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM\\'s use of a\\ncompeting PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft\\'s use of per processor licenses has increased.\"[33]\\n\\n1995–2007: Foray into the Web, Windows 95, Windows XP, and Xbox\\nFollowing Bill Gates\\'s internal \"Internet Tidal Wave memo\" on May 26, 1995, Microsoft began to\\nredefine its offerings and expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web.[34]\\n\\nWith a few exceptions of new companies, like Netscape, Microsoft was the only major and established\\ncompany that acted fast enough to be a part of the World Wide Web practically from the start. Other\\ncompanies like Borland, WordPerfect, Novell, IBM and Lotus, being much slower to adapt to the new\\nsituation, would give Microsoft market dominance.[35]\\n\\nThe company released Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, featuring pre-emptive multitasking, a completely\\nnew user interface with a novel start button, and 32-bit compatibility; similar to NT, it provided the\\nWin32 API.[36][37]:\\u200a20\\u200a Windows 95 came bundled with the online service MSN, which was at first\\nintended to be a competitor to the Internet, and (for OEMs) Internet Explorer, a Web browser. Internet\\nExplorer was not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes, because the boxes were printed before the\\n\\n\\n\\nteam finished the Web browser, and instead were included in\\nthe Windows 95 Plus! pack.[38] Backed by a high-profile\\nmarketing campaign[39] and what The New York Times called\\n\"the splashiest, most frenzied, most expensive introduction of\\na computer product in the industry\\'s history,\"[40] Windows 95\\nquickly became a success.[41] Branching out into new markets\\nin 1996, Microsoft and General Electric\\'s NBC unit created a\\nnew 24/7 cable news channel, MSNBC.[42] Microsoft created\\nWindows CE 1.0, a new OS designed for devices with low\\nmemory and other constraints, such as personal digital\\n\\nIn 1996, Microsoft released Windows CE,\\na version of the operating system meant assistants.[43] In October 1997, the Justice Department filed a\\nfor personal digital assistants and other motion in the Federal District Court, stating that Microsoft\\ntiny computers, shown here on the HP violated an agreement signed in 1994 and asked the court to\\n300LX. stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with\\n\\nWindows.[10]:\\u200a323–324\\u200a\\n\\nOn January 13, 2000, Bill Gates handed over the CEO position to\\nSteve Ballmer, an old college friend of Gates and employee of the\\ncompany since 1980, while creating a new position for himself as\\nChief Software Architect.[10]:\\u200a111,\\u200a228\\u200a[14] Various companies including\\nMicrosoft formed the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance in\\nOctober 1999 to (among other things) increase security and protect\\nintellectual property through identifying changes in hardware and\\nsoftware. Critics decried the alliance as a way to enforce While primarily focused on\\nindiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software, and software, Microsoft also\\nover how computers behave, and as a form of digital rights produced a number of\\nmanagement: for example, the scenario where a computer is not only successful PC accessories, such\\n\\nsecured for its owner but also secured against its owner as as the IntelliMouse computer\\n\\nwell.[44][45] On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the mice shown here\\n\\ncase of United States v. Microsoft Corp.,[46] calling the\\ncompany an \"abusive monopoly\".[47] Microsoft later settled\\nwith the U.S. Department of Justice in 2004.[26]\\n\\nOn October 25, 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP,\\nunifying the mainstream and NT lines of OS under the NT\\ncodebase.[48] The company released the Xbox later that year,\\nentering the video game console market dominated by Sony Microsoft released the first installment in\\nand Nintendo.[49] In March 2004 the European Union brought the Xbox series of consoles in 2001. The\\nantitrust legal action against the company, citing it abused its Xbox, graphically powerful compared to\\n\\ndominance with the Windows OS, resulting in a judgment of its rivals, featured a standard PC\\'s\\n733\\xa0MHz Intel Pentium III processor.\\n\\n€497\\xa0 million ($613\\xa0 million) and requiring Microsoft to\\nproduce new versions of Windows XP without Windows\\nMedia Player: Windows XP Home Edition N and Windows XP Professional N.[50][51] In November 2005,\\nthe company\\'s second video game console, the Xbox 360, was released. There were two versions, a basic\\nversion for $299.99 and a deluxe version for $399.99.[52]\\n\\n\\n\\nIncreasingly present in the hardware business following Xbox, Microsoft 2006 released the Zune series of\\ndigital media players, a successor of its previous software platform Portable Media Center. These\\nexpanded on previous hardware commitments from Microsoft following its original Microsoft Mouse in\\n1983; as of 2007 the company sold the best-selling wired keyboard (Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000),\\nmouse (IntelliMouse), and desktop webcam (LifeCam) in the United States. That year the company also\\nlaunched the Surface \"digital table\", later renamed PixelSense.[53]\\n\\n2007–2011: Microsoft Azure, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Microsoft\\nStores\\n\\nHeadquarters of the European\\n\\nCEO Steve Ballmer at the MIX event in Commission, which has imposed several\\n\\n2008.

Relatively\\n\\nstrong sales of both products helped to produce a record profit\\nin 2007.[57] The European Union imposed another fine of\\n\\n€899\\xa0 million ($1.4\\xa0 billion) for Microsoft\\'s lack of compliance with the March 2004 judgment on\\nFebruary 27, 2008, saying that the company charged rivals unreasonable prices for key information about\\nits workgroup and backoffice servers.[58] Microsoft stated that it was in compliance and that \"these fines\\nare about the past issues that have been resolved\".[59] 2007 also saw the creation of a multi-core unit at\\nMicrosoft, following the steps of server companies such as Sun and IBM.[60]\\n\\nGates retired from his role as Chief Software Architect on June 27, 2008, a decision announced in June\\n2006, while retaining other positions related to the company in addition to being an advisor for the\\ncompany on key projects.[61][62] Azure Services Platform, the company\\'s entry into the cloud computing\\nmarket for Windows, launched on October 27, 2008.[63] On February 12, 2009, Microsoft announced its\\nintent to open a chain of Microsoft-branded retail stores, and on October 22, 2009, the first retail\\nMicrosoft Store opened in Scottsdale, Arizona; the same day Windows 7 was officially released to the\\npublic. Windows 7\\'s focus was on refining Vista with ease-of-use features and performance\\nenhancements, rather than an extensive reworking of Windows.[64][65][66]\\n\\nAs the smartphone industry boomed in the late 2000s, Microsoft had struggled to keep up with its rivals\\nin providing a modern smartphone operating system, falling behind Apple and Google-sponsored Android\\nin the United States.[67] As a result, in 2010 Microsoft revamped its aging flagship mobile operating\\nsystem, Windows Mobile, replacing it with the new Windows Phone OS that was released in October that\\n\\n\\n\\nyear.[68][69] It used a new user interface design language, codenamed \"Metro\", which prominently used\\nsimple shapes, typography, and iconography, utilizing the concept of minimalism. Microsoft implemented\\na new strategy for the software industry, providing a consistent user experience across all smartphones\\nusing the Windows Phone OS. It launched an alliance with Nokia in 2011 and Microsoft worked closely\\nwith the company to co-develop Windows Phone,[70] but remained partners with long-time Windows\\nMobile OEM HTC.[71] Microsoft is a founding member of the Open Networking Foundation started on\\nMarch 23, 2011. Fellow founders were Google, HPE Networking, Yahoo!, Verizon Communications,\\nDeutsche Telekom and 17 other companies. This nonprofit organization is focused on providing support\\nfor a cloud computing initiative called Software-Defined Networking.[72] The initiative is meant to speed\\ninnovation through simple software changes in telecommunications networks, wireless networks, data\\ncenters, and other networking areas.[73]\\n\\n2011–2014: Windows 8/8.1, Xbox One, Outlook.com, and Surface devices\\nFollowing the release of Windows Phone, Microsoft\\nundertook a gradual rebranding of its product range\\nthroughout 2011 and 2012, with the corporation\\'s logos,\\nproducts, services, and websites adopting the principles and\\nconcepts of the Metro design language.[74] Microsoft\\nunveiled Windows 8, an operating system designed to power\\nboth personal computers and tablet computers, in Taipei in\\nJune 2011.[75] A developer preview was released on\\nSeptember 13, which was subsequently replaced by a Surface Pro 3, part of the Surface series\\nconsumer preview on February 29, 2012, and released to the of 2-in-1 laptops by Microsoft\\npublic in May.[76] The Surface was unveiled on June 18,\\nbecoming the first computer in the company\\'s history to have\\nits hardware made by Microsoft.[77][78] On June 25, Microsoft paid US$1.2\\xa0 billion to buy the social\\nnetwork Yammer.[79] On July 31, it launched the Outlook.com webmail service to compete with\\nGmail.[80] On September 4, 2012, Microsoft released Windows Server 2012.[81]\\n\\nIn July 2012, Microsoft sold its 50% stake in MSNBC, which it had run as a joint venture with NBC\\nsince 1996.[82] On October 1, 2012, Microsoft announced its intention to launch a news operation, part of\\na new-look MSN, with Windows 8 later in the month.[83] On October 26, 2012, Microsoft launched\\nWindows 8 and the Microsoft Surface.[78][84] Three days later, Windows Phone 8 was launched.[85] To\\ncope with the potential for an increase in demand for products and services, Microsoft opened a number\\nof \"holiday stores\" across the U.S. to complement the increasing number of \"bricks-and-mortar\"\\nMicrosoft Stores that opened in 2012.[86] On March 29, 2013, Microsoft launched a Patent Tracker.[87]\\n\\nIn August 2012, the New York City Police Department announced a partnership with Microsoft for the\\ndevelopment of the Domain Awareness System which is used for Police surveillance in New York\\nCity.[88]\\n\\nThe Kinect, a motion-sensing input device made by Microsoft and designed as a video game controller,\\nfirst introduced in November 2010, was upgraded for the 2013 release of the Xbox One video game\\nconsole.

An example is Microsoft Canada, which it established in 1985.[223] Other countries\\nhave similar installations, to funnel profits back up to Redmond and to distribute the dividends to the\\nholders of MSFT stock.\\n\\nOwnership\\nThe 10 largest shareholders of Microsoft in early 2024 were:[212][224]\\n\\n\\n\\nShareholder name Percentage\\n\\nThe Vanguard Group 8.9%\\n\\nBlackRock 5.6%\\n\\nState Street Corporation 4.0%\\n\\nSteve Ballmer 4.0%\\n\\nFidelity Investments 2.9%\\n\\nGeode Capital Management 2.1%\\n\\nT.

After suffering extended downtime and unreliability[228][229] the London\\nStock Exchange announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a\\nLinux-based one in 2010.[230][231]\\n\\nIn 2012, Microsoft hired a political pollster named Mark Penn, whom The New York Times called\\n\"famous for bulldozing\" his political opponents[232] as Executive Vice-president, Advertising and\\nStrategy. Penn created a series of negative advertisements targeting one of Microsoft\\'s chief competitors,\\nGoogle. The advertisements, called \"Scroogled\", attempted to make the case that Google is \"screwing\"\\nconsumers with search results rigged to favor Google\\'s paid advertisers, that Gmail violates the privacy of\\n\\n\\n\\nits users to place ad results related to the content of their emails and shopping results, which favor Google\\nproducts. Tech publications like TechCrunch were highly critical of the advertising campaign,[233] while\\nGoogle employees embraced it.[234]\\n\\nLayoffs\\nIn July 2014, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 18,000 employees. Microsoft employed 127,104\\npeople as of June 5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest\\nMicrosoft layoff ever. This included 12,500 professional and factory personnel. Previously, Microsoft had\\neliminated 5,800 jobs in 2009 in line with the Great Recession of 2008–2017.[235][236] In September\\n2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle–Redmond area, where the\\ncompany is headquartered. The firings came as a second wave of the layoffs that were previously\\nannounced. This brought the total number to over 15,000 out of the 18,000 expected cuts.[237] In October\\n2014, Microsoft revealed that it was almost done with eliminating 18,000 employees, which was its\\nlargest-ever layoff sweep.[238] In July 2015, Microsoft announced another 7,800 job cuts in the next\\nseveral months.[239] In May 2016, Microsoft announced another 1,850 job cuts mostly in its Nokia\\nmobile phone division. As a result, the company will record an impairment and restructuring charge of\\napproximately $950\\xa0million, of which approximately $200\\xa0million will relate to severance payments.[240]\\n\\nMicrosoft laid off 1,900 employees in its gaming division in January 2024. The layoffs primarily affected\\nActivision Blizzard employees, but some Xbox and ZeniMax employees were also affected.[241] Blizzard\\npresident Mike Ybarra and chief design officer Allen Adham also resigned.[242]\\n\\nIn May 2025, Microsoft announced that it is laying off more than 6,000 employees, around three percent\\nof the company\\'s entire workforce.[243] In July 2025, Microsoft announced another round of layoffs,\\ncutting approximately 9,000 employees in its largest workforce reduction in over two years. The cuts\\naffected multiple divisions, including Xbox, with 830 positions eliminated at its Redmond, Washington\\nheadquarters.[244][245] Amid the layoffs, Microsoft also announced that it was quitting Pakistan after 25\\nyears of operations.[246][247] While the exit was part of shift in business strategies and preference for\\ncloud based models, the company\\'s exit from Pakistan was also reportedly attributed to \"growing\\ndifficulties\" with the country\\'s business environment.[248]\\n\\nUnions\\nMicrosoft recognizes seven trade unions[e] representing 1,750 workers in the United States at its video\\ngame subsidiaries Activision Blizzard and ZeniMax Media.[249] U.S. workers have been vocal in\\nopposing military and law-enforcement contracts with Microsoft.[250] Bethesda Game Studios is\\nunionized in Canada.[251] Microsoft South Korea has recognized its union since 2017.[252][253] German\\nemployees have elected works councils since 1998.[254]\\n\\nUnited States government\\nMicrosoft provides information about reported bugs in its software to intelligence agencies of the United\\nStates government, prior to the public release of the fix. A Microsoft spokesperson stated that the\\ncorporation runs several programs that facilitate the sharing of such information with the U.S.\\ngovernment.[255] Following media reports about PRISM, NSA\\'s massive electronic surveillance program,\\n\\n\\n\\nin May 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Microsoft.[256]\\n\\nAccording to leaks of said program, Microsoft joined the PRISM program in 2007.[257] However, in June\\n2013, an official statement from Microsoft flatly denied its participation in the program:\\n\\n\"We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so,\\nand never on a voluntary basis. In addition, we only ever comply with orders for requests about\\nspecific accounts or identifiers. If the government has a broader voluntary national security\\nprogram to gather customer data, we don\\'t participate in it.\"[258]\\n\\nDuring the first six months of 2013, Microsoft received requests that affected between 15,000 and 15,999\\naccounts.[259] In December 2013, the company made a statement to further emphasize that it takes its\\ncustomers\\' privacy and data protection very seriously, saying that \"government snooping potentially now\\nconstitutes an \\'advanced persistent threat,\\' alongside sophisticated malware and cyber attacks\".[260] The\\nstatement also marked the beginning of three-part program to enhance Microsoft\\'s encryption and\\ntransparency efforts. On July 1, 2014, as part of this program, it opened the first (of many) Microsoft\\nTransparency Center, which provides \"participating governments with the ability to review source code\\nfor our key products, assure themselves of their software integrity, and confirm there are no \"back\\ndoors.\"[261] Microsoft has also argued that the United States Congress should enact strong privacy\\nregulations to protect consumer data.[262]\\n\\nIn April 2016, the company sued the U.S. government, argued that secrecy orders were preventing the\\ncompany from disclosing warrants to customers in violation of the company\\'s and customers\\' rights.\\nMicrosoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from\\ninforming its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents and that the\\nFourth Amendment made it so people or businesses had the right to know if the government searches or\\nseizes their property. On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit as a result of a policy\\nchange by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ). The DoJ had \"changed data request rules on\\nalerting the Internet users about agencies accessing their information.\"\\n\\nIn 2022 Microsoft shared a $9 billion contract from the United States Department of Defense for cloud\\ncomputing with Amazon, Google, and Oracle.[263]\\n\\nSecurity challenges\\nOn a Friday afternoon in January 2024, Microsoft disclosed that a Russian state-sponsored group hacked\\ninto its corporate systems. The group, accessed \"a very small percentage\" of Microsoft corporate email\\naccounts, which also included members of its senior leadership team and employees in its cybersecurity\\nand legal teams.[264] Microsoft noted in a blog post that the attack might have been prevented if the\\naccounts in question had enabled multi-factor authentication, a defensive measure which is widely\\nrecommended in the industry, including by Microsoft itself.[265]\\n\\n\\n\\nCorporate identity\\n\\nCorporate culture\\nTechnical references for developers and articles for various Microsoft magazines such as Microsoft\\nSystems Journal (MSJ) are available through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). MSDN also\\noffers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer\\naccess to pre-release beta versions of Microsoft software.[266][267] In April 2004, Microsoft launched a\\ncommunity site for developers and users, titled Channel 9, that provides a wiki and an Internet forum.[268]\\n\\nAnother community site that provides daily videocasts and other services, On10.net, launched on March\\n3, 2006.[269] Free technical support is traditionally provided through online Usenet newsgroups, and\\nCompuServe in the past, monitored by Microsoft employees; there can be several newsgroups for a single\\nproduct. Helpful people can be elected by peers or Microsoft employees for Microsoft Most Valuable\\nProfessional (MVP) status, which entitles them to a sort of special social status and possibilities for\\nawards and other benefits.[270]\\n\\nNoted for its internal lexicon, the expression \"eating your own dog food\" is used to describe the policy of\\nusing pre-release and beta versions of products inside Microsoft to test them in \"real-world\"\\nsituations.[271] This is usually shortened to just \"dog food\" and is used as a noun, verb, and adjective.\\nAnother bit of jargon, FYIFV or FYIV (\"Fuck You, I\\'m [Fully] Vested\"), is used by an employee to\\nindicate they are financially independent and can avoid work anytime they wish.[272]\\n\\nMicrosoft is an outspoken opponent of the cap on H-1B visas, which allows companies in the U.S. to\\nemploy certain foreign workers. Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas makes it difficult to hire\\nemployees for the company, stating \"I\\'d certainly get rid of the H1B cap\" in 2005.[273] Critics of H1B\\nvisas argue that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment for U.S. citizens due to H1B\\nworkers working for lower salaries.[274]\\n\\nThe Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, a report of how progressive the organization\\ndeems company policies towards LGBT employees, rated Microsoft as 87% from 2002 to 2004 and as\\n100% from 2005 to 2010 after it allowed gender expression.[275]\\n\\nIn August 2018, Microsoft implemented a policy for all companies providing subcontractors to require 12\\nweeks of paid parental leave to each employee. This expands on the former requirement from 2015\\nrequiring 15 days of paid vacation and sick leave each year.[276] In 2015, Microsoft established its own\\nparental leave policy to allow 12 weeks off for parental leave with an additional 8 weeks for the parent\\nwho gave birth.[277]\\n\\nEnvironment\\nIn 2011, Greenpeace released a report rating the top ten big brands in cloud computing on the sources of\\nelectricity for their data centers. At the time, data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity, and\\nthis amount was projected to increase. Phil Radford of Greenpeace said, \"We are concerned that this new\\nexplosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy\\n\\n\\n\\navailable today\",[278] and called on \"Amazon, Microsoft and other leaders of the information-technology\\nindustry must embrace clean energy to power their cloud-based data centers\".[279] In 2013, Microsoft\\nagreed to buy power generated by a Texas wind project to power one of its data centers.[280]\\n\\nMicrosoft is ranked on the 17th place in Greenpeace\\'s Guide to Greener Electronics (16th Edition) that\\nranks 18 electronics manufacturers according to its policies on toxic chemicals, recycling, and climate\\nchange.[281] Microsoft\\'s timeline for phasing out brominated flame retardant (BFRs) and phthalates in all\\nproducts was 2012 but its commitment to phasing out PVC is not clear. As of January\\xa02011, it has no\\nproducts that are completely free from PVC and BFRs.[282]\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s main U.S. campus received a silver certification from the Leadership in Energy and\\nEnvironmental Design (LEED) program in 2008, and it installed over 2,000 solar panels on top of its\\nbuildings at its Silicon Valley campus, generating approximately 15 percent of the total energy needed by\\nthe facilities in April 2005.[283] Microsoft makes use of alternative forms of transit. It created one of the\\nworld\\'s largest private bus systems, the \"Connector\", to transport people from outside the company; for\\non-campus transportation, the \"Shuttle Connect\" uses a large fleet of hybrid cars to save fuel. The\\n\"Connector\" does not compete with the public bus system and works with it to provide a cohesive\\ntransportation network not just for its employees but also for the public.[284]\\n\\nMicrosoft also subsidizes regional public transport, provided by Sound Transit and King County Metro,\\nas an incentive.[283][285] In February 2010, however, Microsoft took a stance against adding additional\\npublic transport and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to the State Route 520 and its floating bridge\\nconnecting Redmond to Seattle; the company did not want to delay the construction any further.[286]\\n\\nMicrosoft was ranked number 1 in the list of the World\\'s Best Multinational Workplaces by the Great\\nPlace to Work Institute in 2011.[287]\\n\\nIn January 2020, the company announced a strategy to take the company carbon negative by 2030 and to\\nremove all carbon that it has emitted since its foundation in 1975.[288][289][290] On October 9, 2020,\\nMicrosoft permanently allowed remote work.[291] In January 2021, the company announced on Twitter to\\njoin the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, which engages the cloud infrastructure and data centers\\nindustries to reach carbon neutrality in Europe by 2030, and also disclosed an investment in Climeworks,\\na direct air capture company partnered with Carbfix for carbon sequestration.[list 1] In the same year, it\\nwas awarded the EPA\\'s Green Power Leadership Award, citing the company\\'s all-renewable energy use\\nsince 2014.[297]\\n\\nIn September 2023, Microsoft announced that it purchased $200 million in carbon credits to offset\\n315,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide over 10 years from Heirloom Carbon, a carbon removal company\\nthat mixes calcium oxide from heated crushed limestone with water to form carbon hydroxide to absorb\\ncarbon dioxide from the atmosphere to mineralize back into limestone while the released carbon dioxide\\nis stored underground or injected into concrete.[298][299] Despite spending spent more than $760 million\\nthrough its Climate Innovation Fund by June 2024 on sustainability projects—including purchases of\\nmore than 5 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide removal with carbon offsets and more than 34\\nmegawatts of renewable energy—Microsoft\\'s Scope 3 emissions had increased by 31% from the\\ncompany\\'s 2020 baseline, which caused the company\\'s total emissions to rise by 29% in 2023.[300]\\n\\nIn 2023 Microsoft consumed 24 TWh of electricity, more than countries such as Iceland, Ghana, the\\nDominican Republic, or Tunisia.[301]\\n\\n\\n\\nHeadquarters\\nThe corporate headquarters, informally known as the\\nMicrosoft Redmond campus, is located at One Microsoft Way\\nin Redmond, Washington. Microsoft initially moved onto the\\ngrounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, weeks before\\nthe company went public on March 13. The headquarters has\\nsince experienced multiple expansions since its establishment.\\nIt is estimated to encompass over 8\\xa0million ft2 (750,000\\xa0m2)\\nof office space and 30,000–40,000 employees.[302] Additional\\noffices are located in Bellevue and Issaquah, Washington Building 92, home to the Microsoft Visitor\\n(90,000 employees worldwide). The company is planning to Center\\nupgrade its Mountain View, California, campus on a grand\\nscale. The company has occupied this campus since 1981. In\\n2016, the company bought the 32-acre (13\\xa0ha) campus, with plans to renovate and expand it by 25%.[303]\\n\\nMicrosoft operates an East Coast headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina.[304]\\n\\nIn April 2024, it was announced that Microsoft would be opening a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence\\n\\'hub\\' around Paddington in London, England. It was announced that the division would be led by Jordan\\nHoffman, who previously worked for Deepmind and Inflection.[305]\\n\\nFlagship stores\\nOn October 26, 2015, the company opened its retail location\\non Fifth Avenue in New York City. The location features a\\nfive-story glass storefront and is 22,270 square feet.[306] As\\nper company executives, Microsoft had been on the lookout\\nfor a flagship location since 2009.[307] The company\\'s retail\\nlocations are part of a greater strategy to help build a\\nconnection with its consumers. The opening of the store\\ncoincided with the launch of the Surface Book and Surface\\nPro 4.[308] On November 12, 2015, Microsoft opened a Microsoft\\'s Toronto flagship store\\nsecond flagship store, located in Sydney\\'s Pitt Street\\nMall.[309]\\n\\nLogo\\nMicrosoft adopted the so-called \"Pac-Man Logo\", designed by Scott Baker, on February 26, 1987, with\\nthe concept being similar to InFocus Corporation logo that was adapted a year earlier in 1986. Baker\\nstated \"The new logo, in Helvetica italic typeface, has a slash between the o and s to emphasize the \"soft\"\\npart of the name and convey motion and speed\".[310] Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save\\nthe old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter O, nicknamed the blibbet,\\nbut it was discarded.[311]\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s logo with the tagline \"Your potential. Our passion.\"—below the main corporate name—is\\nbased on a slogan Microsoft used in 2008. In 2002, the company started using the logo in the United\\nStates and eventually started a television campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of\\n\"Where do you want to go today?\"[312][313][314] During the private MGX (Microsoft Global Exchange)\\n\\n\\n\\nconference in 2010, Microsoft unveiled the company\\'s next tagline, \"Be What\\'s Next.\"[315] It also had a\\nslogan/tagline \"Making it all make sense.\"[316] The Microsoft Pac-Man logo was used for 25 years, 5\\nmonths, and 28 days until August 23, 2012, being the longest enduring logo to be used by the company.\\n\\nOn August 23, 2012, Microsoft unveiled a new corporate logo at the opening of its 23rd Microsoft store\\nin Boston, indicating the company\\'s shift of focus from the classic style to the tile-centric modern\\ninterface, which it uses/will use on the Windows Phone platform, Xbox 360, Windows 8 and the\\nupcoming Office Suites.[317] The new logo also includes four squares with the colors of the then-current\\nWindows logo which have been used to represent Microsoft\\'s four major products: Windows (blue),\\nOffice (orange), Xbox (green) and Bing (yellow).[318] The logo also resembles the opening of one of the\\ncommercials for Windows 95.[319][320]\\n\\nMicrosoft logo history\\n \\n\\nca. 1975 – 1980: First Microsoft 1980–June 25, 1982: Second\\nlogo.

The organisation\\'s key areas of focus are: donating\\ncloud computing resources to university researchers and\\nnonprofit groups; supporting the expansion of broadband access worldwide; funding international\\ncomputer science education through YouthSpark; supporting tech education in the U.S. from kindergarten\\nto high school; and donating to global child and refugee relief organizations.[323][324]\\n\\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft\\'s president, Brad Smith, announced that an initial batch of\\nsupplies, including 15,000 protection goggles, infrared thermometers, medical caps, and protective suits,\\nwas donated to Seattle, with further aid to come soon.[325]\\n\\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine Microsoft started monitoring cyberattacks originating from the\\nGovernment of Russia and Russia-backed hackers. In June 2022, Microsoft published the report on\\nRussian cyber attacks and concluded that state-backed Russian hackers \"have engaged in \"strategic\\nespionage\" against governments, think tanks, businesses and aid groups\" in 42 countries supporting\\nKyiv.[326][327]\\n\\nMicrosoft also supports initiatives through its AI for Accessibility grant program, providing funding to\\nvarious global organizations that create technologies to enhance accessibility for individuals with\\ndisabilities. Among grant recipients from the Asia-Pacific region are Sri Lankan IT company Fortude,\\nThailand-based Vulcan Coalition, and Indonesian organization Kerjabilitas.[328]\\n\\nControversies\\nCriticism of Microsoft has followed various aspects of its products and business practices. Frequently\\ncriticized are the ease of use, robustness, and security of the company\\'s software. It has also been\\ncriticized for the use of permatemp employees (employees employed for years as \"temporary\", and\\ntherefore without medical benefits), the use of forced retention tactics, which means that employees\\nwould be sued if they tried to leave.[330] Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking\\nemployees, in many cases, leading to burnout within just a few years of joining the company. The\\ncompany is often referred to as a \"Velvet Sweatshop\", a term which originated in a 1989 Seattle Times\\narticle,[331] and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft\\'s own employees.[332]\\n\\nThis characterization is derived from the perception that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its\\nemployees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their\\n(possibly long-term) health.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs reported by several news outlets,[333][334] an Irish\\nsubsidiary of Microsoft based in the Republic of Ireland\\ndeclared £220 bn in profits but paid no corporation tax for the\\nyear 2020. This is due to the company being tax resident in\\nBermuda as mentioned in the accounts for \\'Microsoft Round\\nIsland One, a subsidiary that collects license fees from the use\\nof Microsoft software worldwide. Dame Margaret Hodge, a\\nLabour MP in the UK said, \"It is unsurprising – yet still\\nshocking – that massively wealthy global corporations\\nopenly, unashamedly and blatantly refuse to pay tax on the\\n\\nPRISM is a clandestine surveillance\\nprofits they make in the countries where they undertake program under which the NSA collects\\nbusiness\".[334]\\n\\nuser data from companies like Microsoft\\nand Facebook.[329]\\n\\nIn 2020, ProPublica reported that the company had diverted\\nmore than $39 billion in U.S. profits to Puerto Rico using a\\nmechanism structured to make it seem as if the company was unprofitable on paper. As a result, the\\ncompany paid a tax rate on those profits of \"nearly 0%\". When the Internal Revenue Service audited\\nthese transactions, ProPublica reported that Microsoft aggressively fought back, including successfully\\nlobbying Congress to change the law to make it harder for the agency to conduct audits of large\\ncorporations.[335][336] In 2023, Microsoft reported in a securities filing that the U.S. Internal Revenue\\nService was alleging that the company owed the U.S. $28.9 billion in past taxes, plus penalties related to\\nmis-allocation of corporate profits over a decade.[337]\\n\\n\"Embrace, extend, and extinguish\" (EEE),[338] also known as \"embrace, extend, and exterminate,\"[339] is\\na phrase that the U.S. Department of Justice found[340] that was used internally by Microsoft[341] to\\ndescribe its strategy for entering product categories involving widely used standards, extending those\\nstandards with proprietary capabilities, and then using those differences to strongly disadvantage\\ncompetitors. Microsoft is frequently accused of using anticompetitive tactics and abusing its monopolistic\\npower. People who use their products and services often end up becoming dependent on them, a process\\nis known as vendor lock-in.\\n\\nMicrosoft was the first company to participate in the PRISM surveillance program, according to leaked\\nNSA documents obtained by The Guardian[342] and The Washington Post[343] in June 2013, and\\nacknowledged by government officials following the leak.[344] The program authorizes the government to\\nsecretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Microsoft has\\ndenied participation in such a program.[345]\\n\\nJesse Jackson believes Microsoft should hire more minorities and women. In 2015, he praised Microsoft\\nfor appointing two women to its board of directors.[346]\\n\\nIn 2020, Salesforce, the manufacturer of the Slack platform, complained to European regulators about\\nMicrosoft due to the integration of the Teams service into Office 365. Negotiations with the European\\nCommission continued until the summer of 2023, but, as it became known to the media, they reached an\\nimpasse. Microsoft is now facing an antitrust investigation.[347]\\n\\nIn June 2024, Microsoft Corp. faced a potential EU fine after regulators accused it of abusing market\\npower by bundling its Teams video-conferencing app with its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software. The\\nEuropean Commission issued a statement of objections, alleging Microsoft\\'s practice since 2019 gave\\n\\n\\n\\nTeams an unfair market advantage and limited interoperability with competing software. Despite\\nMicrosoft\\'s efforts to avoid deeper scrutiny, including unbundling Teams, regulators remained\\nunconvinced. This action followed a 2019 complaint from Slack, which was later acquired by Salesforce.\\nMicrosoft\\'s Teams usage soared during the pandemic, growing from 2 million daily users in 2017 to 300\\nmillion in 2023. The company has a history of antitrust battles in the U.S. and Europe, with over €2\\nbillion in EU fines previously imposed for similar abuses.[348]\\n\\nIn October 2024, Microsoft fired two employees, software engineers Ibtihal Aboussad and Vaniya\\nAgrawal,[349] who organized an unauthorized vigil at its Redmond headquarters to honor Palestinians\\nkilled in the Gaza war. The employees, part of the group \"No Azure for Apartheid\", sought to address the\\ncompany\\'s involvement in the Israeli government\\'s use of its technology.[350] On March 20, 2025, before\\nan event at Seattle\\'s Great Hall with Brad Smith and Steve Ballmer, protestors projected \"Microsoft\\npowers genocide\" on the wall. Subsequently, two employees interrupted AI executive Mustafa Suleyman\\nat a speaking event on April 4, 2025, in protest at the company\\'s support of Israel.[351] The Boycott,\\nDivestment and Sanctions movement added Microsoft to its list of targets for partnering \"with the\\napartheid regime of Israel and its prison system\".[352] In February 2025, the Associated Press reported\\nthat the Israeli military was utilizing Microsoft-developed artificial intelligence tools in its military and\\nintelligence operations against the people of Gaza. In May 2025, Microsoft issued an unsigned statement\\nconfirming that these services had been made available to Israel, while denying that these tools were\\nemployed during the massacre of the people of Gaza.[353] In August 2025 it was reported that Microsoft\\nprovides storage for mass-surveilled Palestinian phone calls that have been used to identify bombing\\ntargets in Gaza.[354]\\n\\nIn November 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation into Microsoft,\\nfocusing on potential antitrust violations related to its cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity businesses.\\nThe probe scrutinized Microsoft\\'s bundling of cloud services with products like Office and security tools,\\nas well as its growing AI presence through its partnership with OpenAI. This inquiry is part of broader\\nefforts by the U.S. government to curb the power of major tech companies, especially under FTC chair\\nLina Khan.

Rajeev Motwani\\nand Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and\\nBrin the first paper about the project, describing\\nPageRank and the initial prototype of the Google\\nsearch engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-\\nMolina and Jeffrey Ullman were also cited as\\ncontributors to the project.[36] PageRank was\\ninfluenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring Google\\'s original homepage had a simplistic\\nalgorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by design because the company founders had little\\n\\nRobin Li in 1996, with Larry Page\\'s PageRank patent experience in HTML, the markup language used\\nfor designing web pages[30]\\n\\nincluding a citation to Li\\'s earlier RankDex patent; Li\\nlater went on to create the Chinese search engine\\nBaidu.[37][38]\\n\\nEventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the\\nword googol,[23][39][40] a very large number written 10100 (1 followed by 100 zeros), picked to signify\\nthat the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[41]\\n\\nGoogle was initially funded by an August 1998 investment of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim,[23] co-\\nfounder of Sun Microsystems. This initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company\\nto be able to use the funds.[42][43] Page and Brin initially approached David Cheriton for advice because\\nhe had a nearby office in Stanford, and they knew he had startup experience, having recently sold the\\ncompany he co-founded, Granite Systems, to Cisco for $220 million. David arranged a meeting with Page\\nand Brin and his Granite co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The meeting was set for 8 a.m. at the front\\nporch of David\\'s home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another meeting at Cisco,\\nwhere he now worked after the acquisition, at 9 a.m. Andy briefly tested a demo of the website, liked\\nwhat he saw, and then went back to his car to grab the check. David Cheriton later also joined in with a\\n$250,000 investment.[44][45]\\n\\nGoogle received money from two other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and\\nentrepreneur Ram Shriram.[46] Page and Brin had first approached Shriram, who was a venture capitalist,\\nfor funding and counsel, and Shriram invested $250,000 in Google in February 1998. Shriram knew\\n\\n\\n\\nBezos because Amazon had acquired Junglee, at which Shriram was the president. It was Shriram who\\ntold Bezos about Google. Bezos asked Shriram to meet Google\\'s founders and they met six months after\\nShriram had made his investment when Bezos and his wife were on a vacation trip to the Bay Area.\\nGoogle\\'s initial funding round had already formally closed but Bezos\\' status as CEO of Amazon was\\nenough to persuade Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment.[47][48]\\n\\nBetween these initial investors, friends and family Google raised around $1,000,000, which is what\\nallowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California.[49] Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD\\nstudent at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.[25][50][51]\\n\\nAfter some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[46] a new $25 million\\nround of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[52] with major investors including the venture capital\\nfirms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital.[43] Both firms were initially hesitant about investing jointly in\\nGoogle, as each wanted to retain a larger percentage of control over the company to themselves. Larry\\nand Sergey however insisted on taking investments from both. Both venture companies finally agreed to\\ninvesting jointly $12.5 million each due to their belief in Google\\'s great potential and through the\\nmediation of earlier angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram who had contacts in the venture\\ncompanies.[53]\\n\\nGrowth\\nIn March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California,[54] which is home to several\\nprominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.[55] The next year, Google began selling advertisements\\nassociated with search keywords against Page and Brin\\'s initial opposition toward an advertising-funded\\nsearch engine.[56][25] To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.[57]\\n\\nIn June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!,\\none of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.[58][59]\\n\\nIn 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an\\noffice complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway\\nin Mountain View, California.[61] The complex became known as the\\nGoogleplex, a play on the word googolplex, the number one followed\\nby a googol of zeroes. Three years later, Google bought the property\\nfrom SGI for $319\\xa0 million.[62] By that time, the name \"Google\" had\\nfound its way into everyday language, causing the verb \"google\" to be\\nadded to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford\\nEnglish Dictionary, denoted as: \"to use the Google search engine to\\nobtain information on the Internet\".[63][64] The first use of the verb on\\ntelevision appeared in an October 2002 episode of Buffy the Vampire\\nSlayer.[65]\\n\\nAdditionally, in 2001 Google\\'s investors felt the need to have a strong\\ninternal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the\\nchairman and CEO of Google.[49] Eric was proposed by John Doerr\\nfrom Kleiner Perkins. He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey Google\\'s first production\\n\\nserver[60]\\nand Larry would accept for several months, but they rejected several\\ncandidates because they wanted to retain control over the company.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichael Moritz from Sequoia Capital at one point even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay\\nback Sequoia\\'s $12.5m investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer,\\nwhich had been made verbally during investment negotiations. Eric was not initially enthusiastic about\\njoining Google either, as the company\\'s full potential had not yet been widely recognized at the time, and\\nas he was occupied with his responsibilities at Novell where he was CEO. As part of him joining, Eric\\nagreed to buy $1 million of Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment and to provide\\nfunds Google needed.[66]\\n\\nInitial public offering\\nOn August 19, 2004, Google became a public company via an initial public offering. At that time Page,\\nBrin and Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024.[67] The company\\nopened on the NASDAQ National Market under the ticker symbol GOOGL with an offering of\\n19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[68][69] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a\\nsystem built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.[70][71] The sale of $1.67\\nbillion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[72]\\n\\nOn October 9, 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in\\nGoogle stock,[73][74][75][76] On July 20, 2007, Google bids $4.6 billion\\nfor the wireless-spectrum auction by the FCC.[77] On March 11, 2008,\\nGoogle acquired DoubleClick for $3.1\\xa0 billion, transferring to Google\\nvaluable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and\\nadvertising agencies.[78][79] By 2011, Google was handling\\napproximately 3 billion searches per day. To handle this workload,\\nGoogle built 11 data centers around the world with several thousand\\nservers in each. These data centers allowed Google to handle the ever-\\nchanging workload more efficiently.[49]\\n\\nIn May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google\\nsurpassed one billion for the first time.[80][81] In May 2012, Google\\nacquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5\\xa0billion, in its largest acquisition Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google\\n\\nto date.[82][83][84] This purchase was made in part to help Google gain from 2001 to 2011\\n\\nMotorola\\'s considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless\\ntechnologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[85] mainly\\nApple and Microsoft,[86] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android.[87]\\n\\n2012 onwards\\nIn June 2013, Google acquired Waze for $966 million.[88] While Waze would remain an independent\\nentity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable\\nintegrations between Waze and Google Maps, Google\\'s own mapping service.[89] Google announced the\\nlaunch of a new company, called Calico, on September 19, 2013, to be led by Apple Inc. chairman Arthur\\nLevinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the \"health and well-being\" company\\nwould focus on \"the challenge of ageing and associated diseases\".[90]\\n\\n\\n\\nOn January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquire\\nDeepMind Technologies, a privately held AI company from\\nLondon.[91] Technology news website Recode reported that the\\ncompany was purchased for $400 million, yet the source of the\\ninformation was not disclosed. A Google spokesperson declined to\\ncomment on the price.[92][93] The purchase of DeepMind aids in\\nGoogle\\'s recent growth in the AI and robotics community.[94] In 2015,\\nDeepMind\\'s AlphaGo became the first computer program to defeat a\\ntop human pro at the game of Go.\\n\\nAccording to Interbrand\\'s annual Best Global Brands report, Google\\nhas been the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple\\nInc.) in 2013,[95] 2014,[96] 2015,[97] and 2016, with a valuation of $133\\nbillion.[98] Entrance of building where\\n\\nGoogle and its subsidiary Deep\\n\\nOn August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various Mind are located at 6 Pancras\\n\\ninterests as a conglomerate named Alphabet Inc. Google became Square, London\\n\\nAlphabet\\'s largest subsidiary and the umbrella company for Alphabet\\'s\\nInternet interests. Upon completion of the restructuring, Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google, replacing\\nLarry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.[99][100][101]\\n\\nOn August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore\\nafter he distributed a memo throughout the company that\\nargued bias and \"Google\\'s Ideological Echo Chamber\"\\nclouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that\\nit is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that\\ncause the average woman to be less interested than men in\\ntechnical positions.[102] Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused\\nDamore of violating company policy by \"advancing harmful\\ngender stereotypes in our workplace\", and he was fired on the\\nsame day.[103][104][105] Current CEO, Sundar Pichai, with Prime\\n\\nMinister of India, Narendra Modi\\n\\nBetween 2018 and 2019, tensions between the company\\'s\\nleadership and its workers escalated as staff protested\\ncompany decisions on internal sexual harassment, Dragonfly, a censored Chinese search engine, and\\nProject Maven, a military drone artificial intelligence, which had been seen as areas of revenue growth\\nfor the company.[106][107] On October 25, 2018, The New York Times published the exposé, \"How Google\\nProtected Andy Rubin, the \\'Father of Android\\'\". The company subsequently announced that \"48\\nemployees have been fired over the last two years\" for sexual misconduct.[108] On November 1, 2018,\\nmore than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walk-out to protest the company\\'s\\nhandling of sexual harassment complaints.[109][110] CEO Sundar Pichai was reported to be in support of\\nthe protests.[111] Later in 2019, some workers accused the company of retaliating against internal\\nactivists.[107]\\n\\nOn March 19, 2019, Google announced that it would enter the video game market, launching a cloud\\ngaming platform called Google Stadia.[112]\\n\\n\\n\\nOn June 3, 2019, the United States Department of Justice reported that it would investigate Google for\\nantitrust violations.[113] This led to the filing of an antitrust lawsuit in October 2020, on the grounds the\\ncompany had abused a monopoly position in the search and search advertising markets.[114]\\n\\nIn December 2019, former PayPal chief operating officer Bill Ready became Google\\'s new commerce\\nchief. Ready\\'s role will not be directly involved with Google Pay.[115]\\n\\nIn April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Google announced several cost-cutting measures. Such\\nmeasures included slowing down hiring for the remainder of 2020, except for a small number of strategic\\nareas, recalibrating the focus and pace of investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non-\\nbusiness essential marketing and travel.[116] Most employees were also working from home due to the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the success of it even led to Google announcing that they would be\\npermanently converting some of their jobs to work from home [117]\\n\\nThe 2020 Google services outages disrupted Google services: one in August that affected Google Drive\\namong others, another in November affecting YouTube, and a third in December affecting the entire suite\\nof Google applications. All three outages were resolved within hours.[118][119][120]\\n\\nIn 2021, the Alphabet Workers Union was founded, composed mostly of Google employees.[121]\\n\\nIn January 2021, the Australian Government proposed legislation that would require Google and\\nFacebook to pay media companies for the right to use their content. In response, Google threatened to\\nclose off access to its search engine in Australia.[122]\\n\\nIn March 2021, Google reportedly paid $20 million for Ubisoft ports on Google Stadia.[123] Google spent\\n\"tens of millions of dollars\" on getting major publishers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two to bring some of\\ntheir biggest games to Stadia.[124]\\n\\nIn April 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google ran a years-long program called \"Project\\nBernanke\" that used data from past advertising bids to gain an advantage over competing for ad services.\\nThis was revealed in documents concerning the antitrust lawsuit filed by ten US states against Google in\\nDecember.[125]\\n\\nIn September 2021, the Australian government announced plans to curb Google\\'s capability to sell\\ntargeted ads, claiming that the company has a monopoly on the market harming publishers, advertisers,\\nand consumers.[126]\\n\\nIn 2022, Google began accepting requests for the removal of phone numbers, physical addresses and\\nemail addresses from its search results. It had previously accepted requests for removing confidential data\\nonly, such as Social Security numbers, bank account and credit card numbers, personal signatures, and\\nmedical records. Even with the new policy, Google may remove information from only certain but not all\\nsearch queries. It would not remove content that is \"broadly useful\", such as news articles, or already part\\nof the public record.[127]\\n\\nIn May 2022, Google announced that the company had acquired California based, MicroLED display\\ntechnology development and manufacturing Start-up company Raxium. Raxium is set to join Google\\'s\\nDevices and Services team to aid in the development of micro-optics, monolithic integration, and system\\nintegration.[128][129]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn December 2022, Google debuted OSV-Scanner,[130][131] a Go tool for finding security holes in open\\nsource software, which pulls from the largest open source vulnerability database of its kind to defend\\nagainst supply chain attacks.\\n\\nFollowing the success of ChatGPT and concerns that Google was falling behind in the AI race, Google\\'s\\nsenior management issued a \"code red\"[132] and a \"directive that all of its most important products—those\\nwith more than a billion users—must incorporate generative AI within months\".[133] In March 2023, in\\ndirect response to the rapid rise of ChatGPT, Google released Bard (now Gemini), a generative artificial\\nintelligence chatbot.[134]\\n\\nIn early May 2023, Google announced its plans to build two additional data centers in Ohio. These\\ncenters, which will be built in Columbus and Lancaster, will power up the company\\'s tools, including AI\\ntechnology. The said data hub will add to the already operational center near Columbus, bringing\\nGoogle\\'s total investment in Ohio to over $2 billion.[135]\\n\\nIn August 2024, Google would lose a lawsuit which started in 2020 in lower court, as it was found that\\nthe company had an illegal monopoly over Internet search.[136] D.C. Circuit Court Judge Amit Mehta\\nheld that this monopoly was in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.[137] In September 2024, the EU\\nCourt of Justice, based in Europe, would also find that Google held an illegal monopoly, in this case with\\nregards to its shopping search, and could not avoid paying a €2.4 billion fine.[138] The EU Court of\\nJustice found that Google\\'s treatment of rival shopping searches, which the court referred to as\\n\"discriminatory\", was in violation of the Digital Markets Act.[138]\\n\\nIn October 2024, Google was fined by a local Russian court a symbolic 2.5 decillion dollars for allegedly\\nblocking pro-Kremlin propaganda. No payment was made.[139]\\n\\nIn November 2024, Google announced the establishment of a new AI hub in Saudi Arabia, aiming to\\nsupport the Kingdom\\'s economic growth and technological development as part of its Vision 2030\\ninitiative. This AI hub is projected to contribute up to $71 billion to Saudi Arabia\\'s economy by\\nadvancing AI-driven solutions tailored to the region\\'s specific needs and training local talent.[140]\\n\\nThe partnership between Google and Saudi Arabia includes collaboration with key stakeholders, such as\\nthe Public Investment Fund (PIF), to develop AI applications that will benefit sectors like healthcare,\\nfinance, oil and gas, and logistics. The initiative focuses on creating localized AI technologies, with an\\nemphasis on integrating Arabic language capabilities and enabling widespread cloud adoption.[141]\\n\\nIn March 2025, Google agreed to acquire Wiz, a New York-based cybersecurity startup focusing on cloud\\ncomputing, for US$32 billion. This cash deal would be Google\\'s biggest ever, as well as it currently being\\nthe most expensive deal of 2025. Alphabet reportedly tried to close a deal for only $23 billion in 2024,\\nbut this fell apart after concerns about regulatory hurdles, among other issues. Wiz, a company located in\\nthe U.S. and Israel, was cofounded in 2020 by Assaf Rappaport. The company is backed by a number of\\nSilicon Valley venture capitalists, as well as notably being partnered with Amazon and Microsoft, as\\nlisted in their website. Google reportedly said \"the deal would help artificial-intelligence companies get\\nbetter security and use more than one cloud service.\"[142]\\n\\nIn July 2025, the United States Department of Defense announced that Google had received a $200\\nmillion contract for AI in the military, along with Anthropic, OpenAI, and xAI.[143]\\n\\n\\n\\nProducts and services\\n\\nSearch engine\\nGoogle indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the\\nuse of keywords and operators.[144] According to comScore market research from November 2009,\\nGoogle Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a market share of\\n65.6%.[145] In May 2017, Google enabled a new \"Personal\" tab in Google Search, letting users search for\\ncontent in their Google accounts\\' various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from\\nGoogle Photos.[146][147]\\n\\nGoogle launched its Google News service in 2002, an automated service which summarizes news articles\\nfrom various websites.[148] Google also hosts Google Books, a service which searches the text found in\\nbooks in its database and shows limited previews or and the full book where allowed.[149]\\n\\nGoogle expanded its search services to include shopping (launched originally as Froogle in 2002),[150]\\n\\nfinance (launched 2006),[151] and flights (launched 2011).[152]\\n\\nAdvertising\\nGoogle generates most of its revenues from advertising. This\\nincludes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content\\nproducts on Google and YouTube, Android and licensing and\\nservice fees, including fees received for Google Cloud\\nofferings. Forty-six percent of this profit was from clicks\\n(cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017.\\nThis includes three principal methods, namely AdMob,\\nAdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search,\\netc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.[153] In addition to its\\nown algorithms for understanding search requests, Google Google at ad-tech London, 2010\\nuses technology from its acquisition of DoubleClick, to\\nproject user interest and target advertising to the search\\ncontext and the user history.[154][155] In 2007, Google launched \"AdSense for Mobile\", taking advantage\\nof the emerging mobile advertising market.[156]\\n\\nGoogle Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by\\nexamining click rates for all the links on a page.[157] Google advertisements can be placed on third-party\\nwebsites in a two-part program. Google Ads allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the\\nGoogle content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.[158] The sister service, Google AdSense,\\nallows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads\\nare clicked.[159] One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud, which occurs when\\na person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the\\nadvertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to\\n\\n\\n\\n20\\xa0 percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.[160] Google Search Console (rebranded from Google\\nWebmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security\\nissues of their websites, as well as optimize their website\\'s visibility.\\n\\nGenerative artificial intelligence\\nGoogle had previously used virtual assistants and chatbots, such as Google Bard, prior to the\\nannouncement of Gemini in March 2024. None of them, however, had been seen as legitimate\\ncompetitors to ChatGPT, unlike Gemini.[161] An AI training program for Google employees was also\\nintroduced in April 2024.[162]\\n\\nGoogle has created the text-to-image model Imagen,[163] and the text-to-video model Veo.[164] In 2025,\\nGoogle announced SynthID Detector, a tool that uses watermarking to identify whether content such as\\ntext, images, audio, or video was generated using Google products.[165]\\n\\nIn 2023, Google released NotebookLM, an online tool for synthesizing documents using Gemini. In\\nSeptember 2024, it gained attention for its \"Audio Overview\" feature, which generates podcast-like\\nsummaries of documents.[166][167] Google also developed LearnLM, a family of language models serving\\nas personal AI tutors.[168]\\n\\nConsumer services\\n\\nWeb-based services\\nGoogle offers Gmail for email,[169] Google Calendar for time-management and scheduling,[170] Google\\nMaps and Google Earth for mapping, navigation and satellite imagery,[171] Google Drive for cloud\\nstorage of files,[172] Google Docs, Sheets and Slides for productivity,[172] Google Photos for photo\\nstorage and sharing,[173] Google Keep for note-taking,[174] Google Translate for language translation,[175]\\n\\nYouTube for video viewing and sharing,[176] Google My Business for managing public business\\ninformation,[177] Google Classroom for managing assignments and communication in education,[178] and\\nDuo for social interaction.[179] A job search product has also existed since before 2017,[180][181][182]\\n\\nGoogle for Jobs is an enhanced search feature that aggregates listings from job boards and career\\nsites.[183] Google Earth, launched in 2005, allows users to see high-definition satellite pictures from all\\nover the world for free through a client software downloaded to their computers.[184]\\n\\nSoftware\\nGoogle develops the Android mobile operating system,[185] as well as its smartwatch,[186] television,[187]\\n\\ncar,[188] and Internet of things-enabled smart devices variations.[189] It also develops the Google Chrome\\nweb browser,[190] and ChromeOS, an operating system based on Chrome.[191]\\n\\nHardware\\nIn January 2010, Google released Nexus One, the first Android phone under its own brand.[192] It\\nspawned a number of phones and tablets under the \"Nexus\" branding[193] until its eventual\\ndiscontinuation in 2016, replaced by a new brand called Pixel.[194]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2011, the Chromebook was introduced, which runs on\\nChromeOS.[195]\\n\\nIn July 2013, Google introduced the Chromecast dongle, which allows\\nusers to stream content from their smartphones to televisions.[196][197]\\n\\nIn June 2014, Google announced Google Cardboard, a simple cardboard\\nviewer that lets the user place their smartphone in a special front\\ncompartment to view virtual reality (VR) media.[198]\\n\\nIn October 2016, Google announced Daydream View, a lightweight VR Google Pixel smartphones on\\nviewer which lets the user place their smartphone in the front hinge to display in a store\\nview VR media.[199][200]\\n\\nOther hardware products include:\\n\\nNest, a series of voice assistant smart speakers that can answer voice queries, play music,\\nfind information from apps (calendar, weather etc.), and control third-party smart home\\nappliances (users can tell it to turn on the lights, for example).

At IPO, the company offered\\n19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[68][69] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market\\ncapitalization of more than $23 billion.[72] The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting\\n$350 for the first time on October 31, 2007,[222] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the\\nonline advertising market.[223] The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as\\nopposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds.[223] GOOG shares split into GOOG class C\\nshares and GOOGL class A shares.[224] The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the\\nticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol\\nGGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google\\'s holding company, since the fourth\\nquarter of 2015.[225]\\n\\nIn the third quarter of 2005, Google reported a 700% increase in profit, largely due to large companies\\nshifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the\\nInternet.[226][227][228]\\n\\nFor the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only\\n$112 million in licensing and other revenues.[229] In 2011, 96% of Google\\'s revenue was derived from its\\nadvertising programs.[230]\\n\\nGoogle generated $50 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2012, generating $38 billion the\\nprevious year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, \"We ended 2012 with a strong quarter\\n... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues\\n\\n\\n\\nfor the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half.\"[231]\\n\\nGoogle\\'s consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89\\nbillion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.[232] Google\\'s Internet business was\\nresponsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users\\' clicks on\\nadvertisements.[233] By January 2014, Google\\'s market capitalization had grown to $397 billion.[234]\\n\\nTax avoidance strategies\\nGoogle uses various tax avoidance strategies. On the list of largest technology companies by revenue, it\\npays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1\\nbillion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through Ireland and the Netherlands and then to Bermuda.\\nSuch techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in, for\\ninstance, the UK is 28 per cent.[235] This reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google\\'s transfer\\npricing practices in 2012.[236]\\n\\nIn 2020, Google said it had overhauled its controversial global tax structure and consolidated all of its\\nintellectual property holdings back to the U.S.[237]\\n\\nGoogle Vice-president Matt Brittin testified to the Public Accounts Committee of the UK House of\\nCommons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.[238] In January\\n2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in\\nfuture.[239] In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax\\nbill.[240]\\n\\nIn 2013, Google ranked 5th in lobbying spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked\\n2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.[241]\\n\\nCorporate identity\\nThe name \"Google\" originated from a misspelling of\\n\"googol\",[242][243] which refers to the number represented by a 1\\nfollowed by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their original\\npaper on PageRank:[36] \"We chose our system name, Google, because\\nit is a common spelling of googol, or 10100[,] and fits well with our Google\\'s logo from 2013 to\\n\\n2015. The logo had been used\\ngoal of building very large-scale search engines.\" Having found its with minor changes since 1999.\\nway increasingly into everyday language, the verb \"google\" was\\nadded to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford\\nEnglish Dictionary in 2006, meaning \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the\\nInternet.\"[244][64] Google\\'s mission statement, from the outset, was \"to organize the world\\'s information\\nand make it universally accessible and useful\",[245] and its unofficial slogan is \"Don\\'t be evil\".[246] In\\nOctober 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: \"Do\\nthe right thing\".[247] The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary\\nof Alphabet.\\n\\nThe original Google logo was designed by Sergey Brin.[248] Since 1998, Google has been designing\\nspecial, temporary alternate logos to place on their homepage intended to celebrate holidays, events,\\nachievements and people. The first Google Doodle was in honor of the Burning Man Festival of\\n\\n\\n\\n1998.[249][250] The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in\\ncase the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry\\nand Sergey asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000. From that point\\nonward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed \"Doodlers\".[251]\\n\\nGoogle has a tradition of creating April Fools\\' Day jokes. Its first on April 1, 2000, was Google\\nMentalPlex which allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.[252] In 2007, Google\\nannounced a free Internet service called TiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a\\nconnection by flushing one end of a fiber-optic cable down their toilet.[253]\\n\\nGoogle\\'s services contain easter eggs, such as the Swedish Chef\\'s \"Bork bork bork\", Pig Latin, \"Hacker\"\\nor leetspeak, Elmer Fudd, Pirate, and Klingon as language selections for its search engine.[254] When\\nsearching for the word \"anagram\", meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid\\nwords, Google\\'s suggestion feature displays \"Did you mean: nag a ram?\"[255] Since 2019, Google runs\\nfree online courses to help engineers learn how to plan and author technical documentation better.[256]\\n\\nWorkplace culture\\nOn Fortune magazine\\'s list of the best companies to work for,\\nGoogle ranked first in 2007, 2008 and 2012,[257][258][259] and\\nfourth in 2009 and 2010.[260][261] Google was also nominated\\nin 2010 to be the world\\'s most attractive employer to\\ngraduating students in the Universum Communications talent\\nattraction index.[262] Google\\'s corporate philosophy includes\\nprinciples such as \"you can make money without doing evil\",\\n\"you can be serious without a suit\", and \"work should be\\nchallenging and the challenge should be fun\".[263]\\n\\nGoogle employees marching in the Pride\\nin London parade in 2016\\n\\nAs of September\\xa0 30, 2020, Alphabet Inc. had 132,121\\nemployees,[264] of which more than 100,000 worked for\\nGoogle.[8] Google\\'s 2020 diversity report states that 32 percent of its workforce are women and 68\\npercent are men, with the ethnicity of its workforce being predominantly white (51.7%) and Asian\\n(41.9%).[265] Within tech roles, 23.6 percent were women; and 26.7 percent of leadership roles were held\\nby women.[266] In addition to its 100,000+ full-time employees, Google used about 121,000 temporary\\nworkers and contractors, as of March\\xa02019.[8]\\n\\nGoogle\\'s employees are hired based on a hierarchical system. Employees are split into six hierarchies\\nbased on experience and can range \"from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and\\nexperienced engineers at level six\".[267] As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as\\nInnovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on\\nprojects that interest them. Some of Google\\'s services, such as Gmail, Google News, Orkut, and AdSense,\\noriginated from these independent endeavors.[268] In a talk at Stanford University, Marissa Mayer,\\nGoogle\\'s vice-president of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all\\nnew product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.[269]\\n\\nIn 2005, articles in The New York Times[270] and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its\\nanti-corporate, no evil philosophy.[271][272][273] In an effort to maintain the company\\'s unique culture,\\nGoogle designated a Chief Culture Officer whose purpose was to develop and maintain the culture and\\n\\n\\n\\nwork on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on.[274] Google has also\\nfaced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees.[275][276] In 2013, a class action against\\nseveral Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged \"no cold call\" agreements\\nwhich restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.[277] In a lawsuit filed January 8, 2018, multiple\\nemployees and job applicants alleged Google discriminated against a class defined by their \"conservative\\npolitical views[,] male gender[,] and/or [...] Caucasian or Asian race\".[278]\\n\\nOn January 25, 2020, the formation of an international workers union of Google employees, Alpha\\nGlobal, was announced.[279] The coalition is made up of \"13 different unions representing workers in 10\\ncountries, including the United States, [the] United Kingdom, and Switzerland\".[280] The group is\\naffiliated with the UNI Global Union, which represents nearly 20 million international workers from\\nvarious unions and federations. The formation of the union is in response to persistent allegations of\\nmistreatment of Google employees and a toxic workplace culture.[280][281][278] Google had previously\\nbeen accused of surveilling and firing employees who were suspected of organizing a workers union.[282]\\n\\nIn 2021, court documents revealed that between 2018 and 2020, Google ran an anti-union campaign\\ncalled Project Vivian to \"convince them (employees) that unions suck\".[283]\\n\\nIn February 2025, Google dropped their commitment to make \"diversity, equity, and inclusion part of\\neverything we do\" from their annual investor report. This action followed Meta, Amazon, Pepsi,\\nMcDonald\\'s, Walmart and others who all have rolled back their DEI programmes.[284]\\n\\nOffice locations\\nGoogle\\'s headquarters in Mountain View, California is\\nreferred to as \"the Googleplex\", a play on words on the\\nnumber googolplex and the headquarters itself being a\\ncomplex of buildings. Internationally, Google has over 78\\noffices in more than 50 countries.[285]\\n\\nIn 2006, Google moved into about 300,000 square feet\\n(27,900\\xa0 m2) of office space at 111 Eighth Avenue in\\nManhattan, New York City. The office houses its largest\\nadvertising sales team.[286] In 2010, Google bought the Google\\'s New York City office building\\n\\nhouses its largest advertising sales team.\\nbuilding housing the headquarter, in a deal that valued the\\nproperty at around $1.9 billion.[287][288] In March 2018,\\nGoogle\\'s parent company Alphabet bought the nearby\\nChelsea Market building for $2.4 billion. The sale is touted as\\none of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single\\nbuilding in the history of New York.[289][290][291][292] In\\nNovember 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its\\nNew York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees.[293]\\n\\nGoogle\\'s Toronto office\\nThe same December, it was announced that a $1 billion,\\n1,700,000-square-foot (160,000\\xa0m2) headquarters for Google\\nwould be built in Manhattan\\'s Hudson Square neighborhood.[294][295] Called Google Hudson Square, the\\nnew campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York\\nCity.[296]\\n\\n\\n\\nBy late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division in Ann Arbor,\\nMichigan.[297] In November 2006, Google opened offices on Carnegie Mellon\\'s campus in Pittsburgh,\\nfocusing on shopping-related advertisement coding and smartphone applications and programs.[298][299]\\n\\nOther office locations in the U.S. include Atlanta; Austin; Boulder, Colorado; Cambridge, Massachusetts;\\nSan Francisco; Seattle and Kirkland, Washington; Birmingham, Michigan; Reston, Virginia, Washington,\\nD.C.,[300] and Madison, Wisconsin.[301]\\n\\nIt also has product research and development operations in\\ncities around the world, namely Sydney (birthplace location\\nof Google Maps)[302] and London (part of Android\\ndevelopment).[303] In November 2013, Google announced\\nplans for a new London headquarter, a 1 million square foot\\noffice able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as\\none of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at\\nthe time of the deal\\'s announcement in January,[304] Google\\nsubmitted plans for the new headquarter to the Camden\\nCouncil in June 2017.[305][306] In May 2015, Google Google\\'s Dublin Ireland office,\\nannounced its intention to create its own campus in headquarters of Google Ads for Europe\\nHyderabad, India. The new campus, reported to be the\\ncompany\\'s largest outside the United States, will\\naccommodate 13,000 employees.[307][308]\\n\\nGoogle\\'s Global Offices sum a total of 86 locations worldwide,[309] with 32 offices in North America,\\nthree of them in Canada and 29 in United States Territory, California being the state with the most\\nGoogle\\'s offices with 9 in total including the Googleplex. In the Latin America Region Google counts\\nwith 6 offices, in Europe 24 (3 of them in UK).

The first cable, named Curie,\\nconnects California with Chile and was completed on November 15, 2019.[316][317] The second fully\\nGoogle-owned undersea cable, named Dunant, connects the United States with France and is planned to\\nbegin operation in 2020.[318] Google\\'s third subsea cable, Equiano, will connect Lisbon (Portugal) with\\nLagos (Nigeria) and Cape Town (South Africa).[319] The company\\'s fourth cable, named Grace Hopper,\\nconnects landing points in New York (US), Bude (UK) and Bilbao (Spain), and is expected to become\\noperational in 2022.[320]\\n\\nEnvironment\\nIn October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of solar panels to provide up to 1.6\\nMegawatt of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus\\' energy needs.[321][322] The\\nsystem is the largest rooftop photovoltaic power station constructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one\\nof the largest on any corporate site in the world.[321] Since 2007, Google has aimed for carbon neutrality\\nin regard to its operations.[323]\\n\\nIn Spring 2009, Google hired a herd of 200 goats for a week from California Grazing to mow their lawn.\\nIt was apparently more eco-friendly.[324]\\n\\nGoogle disclosed in September 2011 that it \"continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000\\nhomes\", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon\\nemissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide\\n\\n\\n\\nelectricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels\\nin 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5\\nmillion watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.[325]\\n\\nIn 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable energy project, putting $38.8\\xa0million\\ninto two wind farms in North Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate\\n169.5\\xa0megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes.[326] In February 2010, the Federal Energy\\nRegulatory Commission granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.[327] The\\ncorporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the\\nelectricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.[328]\\n\\nIn July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of power for 20\\nyears.[329]\\n\\nIn December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it would purchase enough renewable\\nenergy to match 100% of the energy usage of its data centers and offices. The commitment will make\\nGoogle \"the world\\'s largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6\\ngigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy\".[330][331][332]\\n\\nIn November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach\\n100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa\\nand one in Oklahoma.[333] In September 2019, Google\\'s chief executive announced plans for a $2 billion\\nwind and solar investment, the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. This will grow their\\ngreen energy profile by 40%, giving them an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean energy, the company said.[334]\\n\\nIn September 2020, Google announced it had retroactively offset all of its carbon emissions since the\\ncompany\\'s foundation in 1998.[335] It also stated that it is committed to operating its data centers and\\noffices using only carbon-free energy by 2030.[336] In October 2020, the company pledged to make the\\npackaging for its hardware products 100% plastic-free and 100% recyclable by 2025. It also said that all\\nits final assembly manufacturing sites will achieve a UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill certification by\\n2022 by ensuring that the vast majority of waste from the manufacturing process is recycled instead of\\nending up in a landfill.[337]\\n\\nIn 2023 Google consumed 24 TWh of electricity, more than countries such as Iceland, Ghana, the\\nDominican Republic, or Tunisia.[338]\\n\\nClimate change denial and misinformation\\nGoogle donates to climate change denial political groups including the State Policy Network and the\\nCompetitive Enterprise Institute.[339][340] The company also actively funds and profits from climate\\ndisinformation by monetizing ad spaces on most of the largest climate disinformation sites.[341] Google\\ncontinued to monetize and profit from sites propagating climate disinformation even after the company\\nupdated their policy to prohibit placing their ads on similar sites.[342]\\n\\n\\n\\nPhilanthropy\\nIn 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic Google.org, with a start-up fund of\\n$1\\xa0billion.[343] The mission of the organization is to create awareness about climate change, global public\\nhealth, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable plug-in hybrid electric vehicle\\nthat can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired Larry Brilliant as the program\\'s executive director in\\n2004[344] and Megan Smith has since replaced him as director.[345]\\n\\nIn March 2007, in partnership with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), Google hosted\\nthe first Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at its headquarters in Mountain View.[346] In 2011, Google\\ndonated €1 million to International Mathematical Olympiad to support the next five annual International\\nMathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).[347][348] In July 2012, Google launched a \"Legalize Love\"\\ncampaign in support of gay rights.[349]\\n\\nIn 2008, Google announced its \"project 10100\", which accepted ideas for how to help the community and\\nthen allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.[350] After two years of no update, during which\\nmany wondered what had happened to the program,[351] Google revealed the winners of the project,\\ngiving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote\\neducation to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.[352]\\n\\nResponding to the humanitarian crisis after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Google announced a\\n$15 million donation to support Ukrainian citizens.[353] The company also decided to transform its office\\nin Warsaw into a help center for refugees.[354]\\n\\nAlso in February 2022, Google announced a $100 million fund to expand skills training and job\\nplacement for low-income Americans, in conjunction with non-profits Year Up, Social Finance, and Merit\\nAmerica.[355]\\n\\nCriticism and controversies\\nGoogle has had criticism over issues such as aggressive tax\\navoidance,[356] search neutrality, copyright, censorship of\\nsearch results and content,[357] and privacy.[358][359]\\n\\nOther criticisms are alleged misuse and manipulation of\\nsearch results, its use of other people\\'s intellectual property,\\nconcerns that its compilation of data may violate people\\'s\\nprivacy, and the energy consumption of its servers, as well as\\nconcerns over traditional business issues such as monopoly,\\nrestraint of trade, anti-competitive practices, and patent San Francisco activists protest privately\\ninfringement. owned shuttle buses that transport\\n\\nworkers for tech companies such as\\nGoogle from their homes in San\\nFrancisco and Oakland to corporate\\ncampuses in Silicon Valley.\\n\\n\\n\\nPolitical controversy\\n\\nUnited States\\nIn a 2022 National Labor Relations Board ruling, court documents suggested that Google sponsored a\\nsecretive project—Project Vivian—to counsel its employees and to discourage them from forming\\nunions.[283]\\n\\nBrazil\\nOn May 1, 2023, Google placed an ad against anti-disinformation Brazilian Congressional Bill No. 2630,\\nwhich was about to be approved, on its search homepage in Brazil, calling on its users to ask\\ncongressional representatives to oppose the legislation. The country\\'s government and judiciary accused\\nthe company of undue interference in the congressional debate, saying it could amount to abuse of\\neconomic power and ordering the company to change the ad within two hours of notification or face fines\\nof R$1 million\\xa0(2023) (US$185,528.76) per non-compliance hour. The company then promptly removed\\nthe ad.[360][361]\\n\\nIsraeli–Palestinian conflict\\nGoogle is also part of Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion deal in which the technology companies Google and\\nAmazon provide Israel and its military with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other cloud\\ncomputing services, including building local cloud sites that will \"keep information within Israel\\'s\\nborders under strict security guidelines.\"[362][363][364] The contract has been criticized by shareholders\\nand employees over concerns that the project could lead to human rights abuses against Palestinians, in\\nthe context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the disputed status of Palestinian territories.[365][366]\\n\\nAriel Koren, a former marketing manager for Google\\'s educational products and an outspoken critic of\\nthe project, wrote that Google \"systematically silences Palestinian, Jewish, Arab and Muslim voices\\nconcerned about Google\\'s complicity in violations of Palestinian human rights—to the point of formally\\nretaliating against workers and creating an environment of fear\", and said she was retaliated against for\\norganizing against the project.[362][367]\\n\\nIn March 2024, The New York Times reported that Google Photos was being used in a facial recognition\\nprogram by Unit 8200, a surveillance unit of the Israeli Defense Forces, to surveil Palestinians in the\\nGaza Strip amid the Gaza war. A Google spokesman commented that the service \"does not provide\\nidentities for unknown people in photographs\".[368]\\n\\nOn April 18, 2024, Google dismissed 28 employees who participated in protests against the company\\'s\\ninvolvement in Project Nimbus, which the employees argued should not be used for military or\\nintelligence services. The protesting employees, part of the group No Tech For Apartheid, staged sit-ins at\\nGoogle\\'s offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California,[369] leading to disruptions and blockages within\\nthe company facilities.[370][371] This had followed reports of Israeli forces killing large numbers of\\nPalestinian civilians while using own Lavender AI system to identify targets.[372][373]\\n\\nOn July 2025, Sergey Brin said in response to a UN report that used the term \"the genocide in Gaza\" and\\nthat claimed Google profited from it: \"throwing around the term genocide in relation to Gaza is deeply\\noffensive to many Jewish people who have suffered actual genocides. I would also be careful citing\\ntransparently antisemitic organizations like the UN in relation to these issues\".[374][375]\\n\\n\\n\\nRussia\\nOn October 31, 2024, the Russian government imposed a \"symbolic\" fine of $20 decillion on Google for\\nblocking pro-Russian YouTube channels. In 2022, during the invasion of Ukraine, a Russian court had\\nordered Google to restore the channels, with penalties doubling every week according to TASS.[376] This\\ncomes alongside other large fines against social media companies accused of hosting content critical of\\nthe Kremlin or supportive of Ukraine.[377]\\n\\nAntitrust\\nIn July 2018, Mozilla program manager Chris Peterson accused Google of intentionally slowing down\\nYouTube performance on Firefox.[378][379] In April 2019, former Mozilla executive Jonathan Nightingale\\naccused Google of intentionally and systematically sabotaging the Firefox browser over the past decade\\nin order to boost adoption of Google Chrome.[379]\\n\\nIn 2019, a hub for critics of Google dedicated to abstaining from using Google products coalesced in the\\nReddit online community /r/degoogle.[380] The DeGoogle grassroots campaign continues to grow as\\nprivacy activists highlight information about Google products, and the associated incursion on personal\\nprivacy rights by the company.\\n\\nGoogle reportedly paid Apple $22 billion in 2022 to maintain its position as the default search engine on\\nSafari. It marks one of the largest payments between two tech giants in recent years.[381]\\n\\nEuropean Union\\nOn June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of\\n€2.42 billion from the European Union for \"promoting its\\nown shopping comparison service at the top of search\\nresults.\"[382]\\n\\nOn July 18, 2018,[383] the European Commission fined\\nGoogle €4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The\\nabuse of dominants position has been referred to as Google\\'s The European Commission, which\\nconstraint applied to Android device manufacturers and imposed three fines on Google in 2017,\\nnetwork operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices 2018, and 2019\\ngoes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018,\\nGoogle confirmed[384] that it had appealed the fine to the\\nGeneral Court of the European Union.[385]\\n\\nOn March 20, 2019, the European Commission imposed a €1.49 billion ($1.69 billion) fine on Google for\\npreventing rivals from being able to \"compete and innovate fairly\" in the online advertising market.\\nEuropean Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had violated EU antitrust\\nrules by \"imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites\" that required them to\\nexclude search results from Google\\'s rivals.[386][387]\\n\\nOn September 14, 2022, Google lost the appeal of a €4.125 billion (£3.5 billion) fine, which was ruled to\\nbe paid after it was proved by the European Commission that Google forced Android phone-makers to\\ncarry Google\\'s search and web browser apps. Since the initial accusations, Google has changed its\\npolicy.[388]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn March 2024, a former Google software engineer and Chinese national, Linwei Ding, was accused of\\nstealing confidential artificial intelligence information from the company and handing it to Chinese\\ncorporations.[389] Ding had allegedly stolen over 500 files from the company over the course of 5 years,\\nhaving been hired in 2019.[390] Upon discovering Ding had been in contact with Chinese state-owned\\ncompanies, Google notified the FBI, who carried on the investigation of the data breach.[391]\\n\\nOn September 10, 2024, Europe\\'s top court imposed a €2.4 billion fine on Google for abusing its\\ndominance in the shopping comparison market, marking the conclusion of a case that began in 2009 with\\na complaint from British firm Foundem.[392]\\n\\nOn September 18, 2024, Alphabet\\'s Google won a €1.49 billion ($1.7 billion) antitrust fine from the\\nEuropean Union, while Qualcomm\\'s efforts to repeal a penalty were unsuccessful. The General Court\\nagreed with many of the European Commission\\'s findings but annulled the Google fine, stating that the\\nCommission failed to consider all relevant factors and did not demonstrate harm to innovation or\\nconsumers. Google noted that it had already changed its contract practices in 2016. Meanwhile,\\nQualcomm saw its fine reduced slightly but failed to overturn the ruling regarding its predatory pricing\\nagainst Icera. Both companies have options to appeal further.[393]\\n\\nUnited States\\nAfter U.S. Congressional hearings in July 2020,[394] and a report from the U.S. House of Representatives\\'\\nAntitrust Subcommittee released in early October,[395] the United States Department of Justice filed an\\nantitrust lawsuit against Google on October 20, 2020, asserting that it has illegally maintained its\\nmonopoly position in web search and search advertising.[396][397] The lawsuit alleged that Google\\nengaged in anticompetitive behavior by paying Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion to be the default\\nsearch engine on iPhones.[398] Later that month, both Facebook and Alphabet agreed to \"cooperate and\\nassist one another\" in the face of investigation into their online advertising practices.[399][400] Another\\nsuit was brought against Google in 2023 for illegally monopolizing the advertising technology\\nmarket.[401] In August 2024, District of Columbia U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled that\\nGoogle held a monopoly in online search and text advertising in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman\\nAntitrust Act.[402][403]\\n\\nOn October 8, 2024, The U.S. government suggested it could request Google to divest parts of its\\nbusiness, such as the Chrome browser and Android, due to its alleged monopoly in online search. The\\nJustice Department aimed to limit Google\\'s growing dominance in areas like AI. Google, which intended\\nto appeal, argued that the proposals were too extreme, while also dealing with other antitrust cases\\ninvolving its app store and advertising operations.[404]\\n\\nIn November 2024, the Justice Department proposed major changes to curb Google\\'s online search\\nmonopoly, including forcing the company to sell its Chrome browser, share search data with competitors,\\nand end exclusive agreements that make Google the default search engine on devices like iPhones. The\\nDoJ also sought a ban on Google re-entering the browser market for five years and restrictions on its\\ninvestments in rival search or AI technologies. Google called these proposals excessive and harmful to\\nconsumers, pledging to appeal. A trial on the case was scheduled for April 2025, though the incoming\\nadministration and new DoJ leadership could potentially alter the course of the proceedings.[405]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn September 2024, Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) provisionally found that Google engaged\\nin anti-competitive practices in the online advertising technology market, potentially harming thousands\\nof UK publishers and advertisers. The investigation claimed Google used its market power to prevent\\nrivals from competing fairly, affecting billions spent on digital ads. Google rejected the findings as\\nflawed, stating its ad tech benefits businesses. If found guilty, Google could face penalties of up to 10%\\nof its global turnover. Similar investigations are ongoing in the U.S. and EU, where regulators have\\nsuggested that Google may need to sell part of its ad-tech business.[406]\\n\\nIt was ruled in 2025 by US Department of Justice alongside 17 other states that Google operates a\\nmonopoly in online advertising technology. The case will now move to a remedies stage which may lead\\nto Alphabet, the owner of Google, being broken up.[407]\\n\\nGender discrimination lawsuit\\nIn 2017, three women sued Google, accusing the company of violating California\\'s Equal Pay Act by\\nunderpaying its female employees. The lawsuit cited the wage gap was around $17,000 and that Google\\nlocked women into lower career tracks, leading to smaller salaries and bonuses. In June 2022, Google\\nagreed to pay a $118 million settlement to 15,550 female employees working in California since 2013. As\\na part of the settlement, Google also agreed to hire a third party to analyze its hiring and compensation\\npractices.[408][409][410]\\n\\nCensorship\\nAccording to Ryan Gallagher of The Intercept in August 2018, Google was developing for the People\\'s\\nRepublic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as Dragonfly) \"that will blacklist\\nwebsites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest\".[411] Google\\nwas grilled at a Senate committee hearing on the project one month later.[412][413] The project was\\ncanceled in December following the backlash it garnered both externally and internally within the\\ncompany.[414][415]\\n\\nData loss\\nIn May 2024, a misconfiguration in Google Cloud led to the accidental deletion of UniSuper\\'s $135\\nbillion Australian pension fund account, affecting over half a million members who were unable to access\\ntheir accounts for a week. The outage, attributed to a cloud service error and not a cyberattack, prompted\\na joint apology from UniSuper and Google Cloud executives, who assured members that no personal data\\nwas compromised and restoration efforts were underway.[416]\\n\\nData privacy\\nOn October 8, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Google and Alphabet due to \"non-public\"\\nGoogle+ account data being exposed as a result of a bug that allowed app developers to gain access to the\\nprivate information of users. The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million with a payout to\\nclaimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12 each.[417][418][419]\\n\\n\\n\\nOn January 21, 2019, French data regulator CNIL imposed a record €50 million fine on Google for\\nbreaching the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation. The judgment claimed Google had\\nfailed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google\\nissued a statement saying it was \"deeply committed\" to transparency and was \"studying the decision\"\\nbefore determining its response.[420]\\n\\nIn November 2019, the Office for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human\\nServices began investigation into Project Nightingale, to assess whether the \"mass collection of\\nindividuals\\' medical records\" complied with HIPAA.[421] According to The Wall Street Journal, Google\\nsecretively began the project in 2018, with St. Louis-based healthcare company Ascension.[422]\\n\\nIn early June 2020, a $5 billion class-action lawsuit was filed against Google by a group of consumers,\\nalleging that Chrome\\'s Incognito browsing mode still collects their user history.[423][424] The lawsuit\\nbecame known in March 2021 when a federal judge denied Google\\'s request to dismiss the case, ruling\\nthat they must face the group\\'s charges.[425][426] Reuters reported that the lawsuit alleged that Google\\'s\\nCEO Sundar Pichai sought to keep the users unaware of this issue.[427] In April 2024, it was announced\\nthat Google agreed to settle this lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement Google agreed to destroy\\nbillions of data records to settle a lawsuit claiming it secretly tracked the internet use of people who\\nthought they were browsing privately.[428]\\n\\nOn January 6, 2022, France\\'s data privacy regulatory body CNIL fined Alphabet\\'s Google 150 million\\neuros (US$169 million) for not allowing its Internet users an easy refusal of cookies along with\\nFacebook.[429]\\n\\nIn August 2024, Google sent an email to users informing them of its legal obligation to disclose certain\\nconfidential information to U.S. government authorities. The company stated that when it receives valid\\nrequests from government agencies to produce documents without redacting confidential customer\\ninformation, it may produce such documents even if they are confidential to users. However, it will\\nrequest confidential treatment of such information from the government.[430]\\n\\nIn January 2025, U.S. federal judge Richard Seeborg rejected Google\\'s motion to dismiss a class-action\\nlawsuit. The lawsuit claims Google collected data from users who had specifically opted out of tracking.\\nThe trial is scheduled for August 2025.[431]\\n\\nGeolocation\\nGoogle has been criticized for continuing to collect location data from users who had turned off location-\\nsharing settings.[432] In 2020, the FBI used a geofence warrant to request data from Google about\\nAndroid devices near the Seattle Police Officers Guild building following an arson attempt during Black\\nLives Matter protests. Google provided anonymized location data from devices in the area, which raised\\nprivacy concerns due to the potential inclusion of unrelated protesters.[433]\\n\\nCopyright infringement\\nOn March 20, 2024, Google was fined approximately $270 million by French regulators for using content\\nfrom news outlets in France without proper disclosure to train its AI, Bard, now renamed Gemini,\\nviolating a previous commitment to negotiate content use transparently and fairly.[434]\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. government contracts\\nFollowing media reports about PRISM, the NSA\\'s massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013,\\nseveral technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.[435] According to\\nunnamed sources, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009, as YouTube in 2010.[436]\\n\\nGoogle has worked with the United States Department of Defense on drone software through the 2017\\nProject Maven that could be used to improve the accuracy of drone strikes.[437] In April 2018, thousands\\nof Google employees, including senior engineers, signed a letter urging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to\\nend this controversial contract with the Pentagon.[438] Google ultimately decided not to renew this DoD\\ncontract, which was set to expire in 2019.[439]\\n\\nIn 2022 Google shared a $9 billion contract from the Pentagon for cloud computing with Amazon,\\nMicrosoft, and Oracle.[440]\\n\\nSee also\\nOutline of Google Google ATAP\\nGooglization\\n\\nNotes\\na. Google was incorporated on September 4, 1998, however, since 2002, the company has\\n\\ncelebrated its anniversaries on various days in September, most frequently on September\\n27.[1][2][3] The shift in dates reportedly happened to celebrate index-size milestones in\\ntandem with the birthday.[4]\\n\\nReferences\\n1.

Musk\\napproached five people for the initial positions at the fledgling company, including Griffin, who declined\\nthe position of Chief Engineer,[21]:\\u200a11\\u200a Jim Cantrell and John Garvey (Cantrell and Garvey later founded\\nthe company Vector Launch), rocket engineer Tom Mueller, and Chris Thompson.[21][22] SpaceX was\\nfirst headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. Early SpaceX employees, such as Tom\\nMueller (CTO), Gwynne Shotwell (COO), and Chris Thompson (VP of Operations), came from\\nneighboring TRW and Boeing corporations. By November 2005, the company had 160 employees.[23]\\n\\nMusk personally interviewed and approved all of SpaceX\\'s early employees.[21]:\\u200a22\\u200a\\n\\nMusk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of\\naccess to space, ultimately by a factor of ten.[24]\\n\\n\\n\\n2005–2009: Falcon 1 and first orbital launches\\nSpaceX developed its first orbital launch vehicle, the Falcon\\n1, with internal funding.[25][26] The Falcon 1 was an\\nexpendable two-stage-to-orbit small-lift launch vehicle. The\\ntotal development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately\\n$90\\xa0million[27] to $100\\xa0million.[21]:\\u200a215\\u200a\\n\\nThe Falcon rocket series was named after Star Wars \\'s\\nMillennium Falcon fictional spacecraft.[28]\\n\\nIn 2004, SpaceX protested against NASA to the Government\\nAccountability Office (GAO) because of a sole-source The first successful Falcon 1 launch in\\n\\nSeptember 2008\\ncontract awarded to Kistler Aerospace. Before the GAO could\\nrespond, NASA withdrew the contract, and formed the COTS\\nprogram.[21]:\\u200a109–110\\u200a[29] In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a human-rated commercial space\\nprogram through the end of the decade, a program that would later become the Dragon spacecraft.[30] In\\n2006, the company was selected by NASA and awarded $396\\xa0million to provide crew and cargo resupply\\ndemonstration contracts to the International Space Station (ISS) under the COTS program.[31]\\n\\nThe first two Falcon 1 launches were purchased by the United States Department of Defense under the\\nDARPA Falcon Project which evaluated new U.S. launch vehicles suitable for use in hypersonic missile\\ndelivery for Prompt Global Strike.[26][32][33] The first three launches of the rocket, between 2006 and\\n2008, all resulted in failures, which almost ended the company. Financing for Tesla Motors had failed, as\\nwell,[34] and consequently Tesla, SolarCity, and Musk personally were all nearly bankrupt at the same\\ntime.[21]:\\u200a178–182\\u200a Musk was reportedly \"waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain\" because\\nof the stress.[21]:\\u200a216\\u200a\\n\\nThe financial situation started to turn around with the first successful launch achieved on the fourth\\nattempt on September 28, 2008. Musk split his remaining $30\\xa0million between SpaceX and Tesla, and\\nNASA awarded the first Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract awarding $1.6\\xa0billion to SpaceX\\nin December, thus financially saving the company.[21]:\\u200a217–221\\u200a Based on these factors and the further\\nbusiness operations they enabled, the Falcon 1 was soon retired following its second successful, and fifth\\ntotal, launch in July 2009. This allowed SpaceX to focus company resources on the development of a\\nlarger orbital rocket, the Falcon 9.[35] Gwynne Shotwell was also promoted to company president at the\\ntime, for her role in successfully negotiating the CRS contract with the NASA Associate Administrator\\nBill Gerstenmaier.[36][21]:\\u200a222\\u200a\\n\\n2010–2012: Falcon 9, Dragon, and NASA contracts\\nSpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity\\nvehicle, the Falcon 5.[37] The company instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of the\\nFalcon 9, a reusable heavier lift vehicle. Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated by NASA, which\\ncommitted to purchasing several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This\\nstarted with seed money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in\\n2006.[38] The overall contract award was $278\\xa0million to provide development funding for the Dragon\\n\\n\\n\\nspacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9\\nwith Dragon.[38] As part of this contract, the Falcon 9\\nlaunched for the first time in June 2010 with the Dragon\\nSpacecraft Qualification Unit, using a mockup of the Dragon\\nspacecraft.\\n\\nThe first operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in\\nDecember 2010 aboard COTS Demo Flight 1, the Falcon 9\\'s 0:00\\n\\nsecond flight, and safely returned to Earth after two orbits,\\ncompleting all its mission objectives.[39] By December 2010,\\nthe SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 Video of the first launch of Falcon 9\\n\\nand Dragon every three months.[40]\\n\\nIn April 2011, as part of its second-round Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, NASA\\nissued a $75\\xa0million contract for SpaceX to develop an integrated launch escape system for Dragon in\\npreparation for human-rating it as a crew transport vehicle to the ISS.[41] NASA awarded SpaceX a fixed-\\nprice Space Act Agreement (SAA) to produce a detailed design of the crew transportation system in\\nAugust 2012.[42]\\n\\nIn early 2012, approximately two-thirds of SpaceX stock was owned by Musk[43] and his seventy million\\nshares were then estimated to be worth $875\\xa0 million on private markets,[44] valuing SpaceX at\\n$1.3\\xa0 billion.[45] In May 2012, with the Dragon C2+ launch, Dragon became the first commercial\\nspacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.[46] After the flight, the company private\\nequity valuation nearly doubled to $2.4\\xa0billion or $20/share.[47][48] By that time, SpaceX had operated on\\ntotal funding of approximately $1\\xa0 billion over its first decade of operation. Of this, private equity\\nprovided approximately $200\\xa0 million, with Musk investing approximately $100\\xa0 million and other\\ninvestors having put in about $100\\xa0million.[49]\\n\\nSpaceX\\'s active reusability test program began in late 2012 with testing low-altitude, low-speed aspects\\nof the landing technology.[50] The Falcon 9 prototypes performed vertical takeoffs and landings (VTOL).\\nHigh-velocity, high-altitude tests of the booster atmospheric return technology began in late 2013.[50]\\n\\n2013–2015: Commercial launches and rapid growth\\nSpaceX launched the first commercial mission for a private customer in 2013. In 2014, SpaceX won nine\\ncontracts out of the 20 that were openly competed worldwide.[51] That year Arianespace requested that\\nEuropean governments provide additional subsidies to face the competition from SpaceX.[52][53]\\n\\nBeginning in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing also began to affect the market for launch of U.S.\\nmilitary payloads, which for nearly a decade had been dominated by the large U.S. launch provider\\nUnited Launch Alliance (ULA).[54] The monopoly had allowed launch costs by the U.S. provider to rise\\nto over $400\\xa0million over the years.[55] In September 2014, NASA\\'s Director of Commercial Spaceflight,\\nKevin Crigler, awarded SpaceX the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract to\\nfinalize the development of the Crew Transportation System. The contract included several technical and\\ncertification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six operational missions after\\ncertification.[42]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn January 2015, SpaceX raised $1\\xa0billion in funding from Google and\\nFidelity Investments, in exchange for 8.33% of the company,\\nestablishing the company valuation at approximately $12\\xa0 billion.[56]\\n\\nThe same month SpaceX announced the development of a new satellite\\nconstellation, called Starlink, to provide global broadband internet\\nservice with 4,000 satellites.[57]\\n\\nThe Falcon 9 had its first major failure in late June 2015, when the\\nseventh ISS resupply mission, CRS-7 exploded two minutes into the\\nflight. The problem was traced to a failed two-foot-long steel strut that\\nheld a helium pressure vessel, which broke free due to the force of\\nacceleration. This caused a breach and allowed high-pressure helium to\\nescape into the low-pressure propellant tank, causing the failure.[58]\\n\\n2015–2017: Reusability milestones Launch of Falcon 9 carrying\\nORBCOMM OG2-M1, July\\n\\nSpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage 2014\\nin December 2015 with Falcon 9 Flight 20.[59] In April 2016, the\\ncompany achieved the first successful landing on the\\nautonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS) Of Course I Still\\nLove You in the Atlantic Ocean.[60] By October 2016,\\nfollowing the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they\\nwere offering their customers a 10% price discount if they\\nchoose to fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9 first\\nstage.[61]\\n\\nA second major rocket failure happened in early September\\n2016, when a Falcon 9 exploded during a propellant fill Falcon 9 first stage on an autonomous\\noperation for a standard pre-launch static fire test. The spaceport drone ship (ASDS) barge after\\n\\npayload, the AMOS-6 communications satellite valued at the first successful landing at sea,\\n\\n$200\\xa0million, was destroyed.[62] The explosion was caused by SpaceX CRS-8 mission\\n\\nthe liquid oxygen that is used as propellant turning so cold\\nthat it solidified and ignited with carbon composite helium vessels.[63] Though not considered an\\nunsuccessful flight, the rocket explosion sent the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it\\nworked out what went wrong. SpaceX returned to flight in January 2017.[64]\\n\\nIn March 2017, SpaceX launched a returned Falcon 9 for the SES-10 satellite. This was the first time a\\nre-launch of a payload-carrying orbital rocket went back to space.[65] The first stage was recovered again,\\nalso making it the first landing of a reused orbital class rocket.[66]\\n\\n2017–2018: Leading global commercial launch provider\\nIn July 2017, the company raised $350\\xa0 million, which raised its valuation to $21\\xa0 billion.[67] In 2017,\\nSpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch contracts.[68] By March\\n2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest representing about $12\\xa0 billion in contract\\nrevenue.[69] The contracts included both commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers.[70] This\\nmade SpaceX the leading global commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches.[71]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2017, SpaceX formed a subsidiary, The Boring Company,[72] and began work to construct a short test\\ntunnel on and adjacent to the SpaceX headquarters and manufacturing facility, using a small number of\\nSpaceX employees,[73] which was completed in May 2018,[74] and opened to the public in December\\n2018.[75] During 2018, The Boring Company was spun out into a separate corporate entity with 6% of the\\nequity going to SpaceX, less than 10% to early employees, and the remainder of the equity to Elon\\nMusk.[75]\\n\\nSince 2019: Starship, first crewed launches, Starlink and general\\nIn 2019 SpaceX raised $1.33\\xa0 billion of capital across three funding rounds.[76] By May 2019, the\\nvaluation of SpaceX had risen to $33.3\\xa0billion[77] and reached $36\\xa0billion by March 2020.[78]\\n\\nOn August 19, 2020, after a $1.9\\xa0billion funding round, one of the largest single fundraising pushes by\\nany privately held company, SpaceX\\'s valuation increased to $46\\xa0billion.[79][80][81]\\n\\nIn February 2021, SpaceX raised an additional $1.61\\xa0billion in an equity round from 99 investors[82] at a\\nper share value of approximately $420,[81] raising the company valuation to approximately $74\\xa0billion.\\nBy 2021, SpaceX had raised more than $6\\xa0billion in equity financing. Most of the capital raised since\\n2019 has been used to support the operational fielding of the Starlink satellite constellation and the\\ndevelopment and manufacture of the Starship launch vehicle.[82] By October 2021, the valuation of\\nSpaceX had risen to $100.3\\xa0billion.[83] On April 16, 2021, Starship HLS won a contract to play a critical\\nrole in the NASA crewed spaceflight Artemis program.[84] By 2021, SpaceX had entered into agreements\\nwith Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure to provide on-ground computer and networking\\nservices for Starlink.[85] A new round of financing in 2022 valued SpaceX at $127\\xa0billion.[86]\\n\\nIn July 2021, SpaceX unveiled another drone ship named A Shortfall of Gravitas, landing a booster from\\nCRS-23 on it for the first time on August 29, 2021.[87] Within the first 130 days of 2022, SpaceX had 18\\nrocket launches and two astronaut splashdowns. On December 13, 2021, company CEO Elon Musk\\nannounced that the company was starting a carbon dioxide removal program that would convert captured\\ncarbon into rocket fuel,[88][89] after he announced a $100\\xa0million donation to the X Prize Foundation the\\nprevious February to provide the monetary rewards to winners in a contest to develop the best carbon\\ncapture technology.[90][91]\\n\\nIn August 2022, Reuters reported that the European Space Agency (ESA) began initial discussions with\\nSpaceX that could lead to the company\\'s launchers being used temporarily, given that Russia blocked\\naccess to Soyuz rockets amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[92] Since that invasion and in the greater\\nwar between Russia and Ukraine, Starlink was extensively used.[93]\\n\\nIn 2022, SpaceX\\'s Falcon 9 also became the world record holder for the most launches of a single vehicle\\ntype in a single year.[94][95] SpaceX launched a rocket approximately every six days in 2022, with 61\\nlaunches in total. All but one (a Falcon Heavy in November) was on a Falcon 9 rocket.[94]\\n\\nIn November 2023, SpaceX announced it would acquire its parachute supplier Pioneer Aerospace out of\\nbankruptcy for $2.2 million.[96][97]\\n\\nOn July 16, 2024, Elon Musk posted on X that SpaceX would move its headquarters from Hawthorne,\\nCalifornia, to SpaceX Starbase in Brownsville, Texas. Musk said this was because the recently passed\\nCalifornia AB1955 bill \"and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies\".[98]\\n\\n\\n\\nThis new law in California bans school districts from requiring that teachers notify parents about changes\\nto a student\\'s sexual orientation and gender identity.[99] The headquarters officially moved to\\nBrownsville, Texas in August 2024, according to records filed with the California Secretary of State.[100]\\n\\nThe move to relocate SpaceX\\'s headquarters was seen as largely symbolic, at least in the short term. The\\nHawthorne facility continues to support the company\\'s Falcon launch vehicles, which was SpaceX\\'s\\nworkhorse product in 2024.[101]\\n\\nSpaceX\\'s 2024 Polaris Dawn mission featured the first-ever private spacewalk, marking a major\\nmilestone in commercial space exploration.[102]\\n\\nIn 2025 ProPublica reported that Chinese investors were investing in SpaceX via offshore entities, such\\nas the Cayman Islands. Experts speculated that this might raise national security concerns with\\nregulators.[103]\\n\\nBy July 2025, as part of $5 Billion equity raise SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI.[104]\\n\\nStarship\\nIn January 2019, SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce to help finance the Starship\\nand Starlink projects.[105] The purpose of the Starship vehicle is to enable large-scale transit of humans\\nand cargo to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.[106] SpaceX\\'s Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket\\never flown, with a planned payload capacity of 100+ tons.[107][108] Construction of initial prototypes and\\ntests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas. All Starship construction and testing moved\\nto the new SpaceX South Texas launch site later that year.\\n\\nOn April 20, 2023, Starship\\'s first orbital flight test ended in a mid-air explosion over the Gulf of Mexico\\nbefore booster separation. After launch, multiple engines in the booster progressively failed, causing the\\nvehicle to reach max q later than planned. \"Max q\" is the theoretical point of maximal mechanical stress\\nwhich occurs during the launch sequence of a space vehicle. In the case of a rocket that must be self-\\ndestructed during its ascent, max q occurs at the point of self-destruction. Eventually, the vehicle lost\\ncontrol and spun erratically until the automated flight termination system was activated, which\\nintentionally destroyed the rocket. Elon Musk, SpaceX, and other individuals familiar with the space\\nindustry have referred to the test flight as a success.[109][110]\\n\\nMusk said at the time that it would take \"six to eight weeks\" to get the infrastructure prepared for another\\nlaunch. In October 2023, a senior SpaceX executive stated the company had been ready to launch the\\nnext test flight since September. He accused government regulators of disrupting the project\\'s progress,\\nadding the delay could lead to China beating U.S. astronauts back to the Moon.[111][112]\\n\\nOn November 18, 2023, SpaceX launched Starship on its second flight test, with both vehicles flying for\\na few minutes before separately exploding.[113][114][115][116]\\n\\nIn early March 2024 SpaceX announced that it was targeting March 14 as the tentative launch date for its\\nnext uncrewed Starship launch configuration flight test, pending the issuance of a \"launch license\" by the\\nFAA. This license was granted on March 13, 2024.[117] On March 14, 2024, at 13:25 UTC, Starship\\n\\n\\n\\nlaunched for the third time and for the first time Starship reached its\\nplanned suborbital trajectory. The flight ended with the booster\\nexperiencing a malfunction shortly before landing and the ship being\\nlost during re-entry over the Indian Ocean.[107][108]\\n\\nOn June 4, 2024, SpaceX received the launch license for Starship\\'s\\nfourth flight test. The licensure itself was notable in that it was the first\\ntime that the FAA included a clause that would allow SpaceX to launch\\nsubsequent test flights without a mishap investigation, provided that\\nthey met a similar launch profile and used the same specification of\\nhardware. The provision could prove to speed the development\\ntimeline.[118]\\n\\nOn October 12, 2024, SpaceX received FAA approval for Starship\\'s\\nfifth flight test.[119] The flight was the first without engine failures, and\\nthe first successful tower catch.[120]\\n\\nSpaceX launched Starship on its sixth flight test on November 19,\\n2024.[121] The booster aborted the catch attempt, while the ship\\nconducted a relight in space.[122][123]\\n\\nOn January 16, 2025, SpaceX launched Starship on its seventh flight\\ntest, with the first Block 2 Ship, Ship 33 (standing at 403\\xa0 ft or 123\\nmeters). This test also carried a demonstration payload, a Starlink V3\\nsimulator. The test launched at 22:37 UTC. The test resulted in the\\nsecond catch of the Super Heavy booster, B14, but after 8 minutes,\\nSpaceX lost contact with \\'Ship\\', which is the upper stage of the Starship\\nwhich resulted in the failure of the ship during the ascent. The\\nspacecraft reportedly exploded around 8.5 minutes after launch over\\nthe Atlantic Ocean near the Turks and Caicos Islands. The FAA, on Starship in launch position\\nJanuary 18, required a mishap investigation of the failure.[124]\\n\\nOn March 7, 2025, SpaceX launched another Starship rocket,\\nthis time from Texas. Contact was lost minutes into the test\\nflight and the spacecraft came tumbling down and broke\\napart, with wreckage seen across Florida\\'s skies.[125] As per\\npreliminary investigation, Starship’s 7th test flight was\\ndisrupted by an oxygen leak, flashes and sustained fires in its\\naft section, which caused the rocket’s engines to shut down\\nand turn on the spacecraft’s self-destruct system.[126]\\n\\nOn June 18, 2025, a SpaceX Starship rocket exploded during Dragon\\'s Flight: SpaceX Crew-10\\nlaunches aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9\\n\\na static fire test at the company’s Starbase facility in Texas, rocket carrying the Dragon spacecraft\\nfollowing what the company described as a “major piloted by astronaut and Air Force Maj.\\nanomaly”.[127]\\n\\nNichole \"Vapor\" Ayer at Kennedy Space\\nCenter, FL, March 14, 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nCrewed launches\\nA significant milestone was achieved in May 2020, when\\nSpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Doug\\nHurley and Bob Behnken) into orbit on a Crew Dragon\\nspacecraft during Crew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX the\\nfirst private company to send astronauts to the International\\nSpace Station and marking the first crewed orbital launch\\nfrom American soil in 9 years.[128][129] The mission launched\\nfrom Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A)\\nin Florida.[130]\\n\\nNASA astronauts Douglas Hurley (left)\\nand Robert Behnken (right) wearing\\n\\nStarlink custom-fit spacesuits designed by\\nSpaceX.\\n\\nIn May 2019, SpaceX launched the first large batch of 60\\nStarlink satellites, beginning to deploy what would become\\nthe world\\'s largest commercial satellite constellation the following year.[131] In 2022, most SpaceX\\nlaunches focused on Starlink, a consumer internet business that sends batches of internet-beaming\\nsatellites and now has over 6,000 satellites in orbit.[132]\\n\\nOn July 16, 2021, SpaceX entered an agreement to acquire Swarm Technologies, a private company\\nbuilding a low Earth orbit satellite constellation for communications with Internet of things (IoT) devices,\\nfor $524\\xa0million.[133][134]\\n\\nIn December 2022, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the launch of up to\\n7,500 of SpaceX\\'s next-generation satellites in its Starlink internet network.[135]\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary of achievements\\n\\nDate Achievement Flight\\n\\nFirst privately funded, fully liquid-fueled rocket to reach\\nSeptember 28, 2008\\n\\norbit.[136] Falcon 1 Flight 4\\n\\nJuly 14, 2009 First privately funded, fully liquid-fueled rocket to put a\\ncommercial satellite in orbit.

It uses three slightly\\nmodified Falcon 9 first-stage cores with a total of 27 Merlin 1D engines.[158][159] The Falcon Heavy\\nsuccessfully flew its inaugural mission on February 6, 2018, launching Musk\\'s personal Tesla Roadster\\ninto heliocentric orbit.[160]\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are certified to conduct launches for the National Security Space\\nLaunch (NSSL).[161][162] As of August 22, 2025, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy have been launched 529\\ntimes, resulting in 526 full mission successes, one partial success, and one in-flight failure. In addition, a\\nFalcon 9 experienced a pre-flight failure before a static fire test in 2016.[163][164]\\n\\nSpaceX is developing a fully reusable super-heavy lift launch system known as Starship. It comprises a\\nreusable first stage, called Super Heavy, and the reusable Starship second stage space vehicle. As of 2017,\\nthe system was intended to supersede the company\\'s existing launch vehicle hardware by the early\\n2020s.[165][166]\\n\\nRocket engines\\nSince the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company\\nhas developed several rocket engines\\xa0 – Merlin,\\nKestrel, and Raptor\\xa0 – for use in launch\\nvehicles,[167][168] Draco for the reaction control\\nsystem of the Dragon series of spacecraft,[169] and\\nSuperDraco for abort capability in Crew Dragon.[170]\\n\\nMerlin is a family of rocket engines that uses liquid\\noxygen (LOX) and RP-1 propellants. Merlin was first\\nused to power the Falcon 1\\'s first stage and is now\\nused on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy Merlin 1D engine undergoes a test at SpaceX\\'s\\nvehicles.[171] Kestrel uses the same propellants and Rocket Development and Test Facility in\\n\\nwas used as the Falcon 1 rocket\\'s second-stage main McGregor, Texas\\n\\nengine.[168][172]\\n\\nDraco and SuperDraco are hypergolic liquid-propellant rocket engines. Draco engines are used on the\\nreaction control system of the Dragon and Dragon 2 spacecraft.[169] The SuperDraco engine is more\\npowerful, and eight SuperDraco engines provide launch escape capability for crewed Dragon 2 spacecraft\\nduring an abort scenario.[173]\\n\\nRaptor is a new family of liquid oxygen and liquid methane-fueled full-flow staged combustion cycle\\nengines to power the first and second stages of the in-development Starship launch system.[167]\\n\\nDevelopment versions were test-fired in late 2016,[174] and the engine flew for the first time in 2019,\\npowering the Starhopper vehicle to an altitude of 20\\xa0m (66\\xa0ft).[175]\\n\\nDragon spacecraft\\nSpaceX has developed the Dragon spacecraft to transport cargo and crew to the International Space\\nStation (ISS).\\n\\nThe first-generation Dragon 1 spacecraft was used only for cargo operations. It was developed with\\nfinancial support from NASA under the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program.\\nAfter a successful COTS demonstration flight in 2010, SpaceX was chosen to receive a Commercial\\nResupply Services (CRS) contract.[39]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe currently operational second-generation Dragon 2\\nspacecraft conducted its first flight, without crew, to the ISS\\nin early 2019, followed by a crewed flight of Dragon 2 in\\n2020.[128] It was developed with financial support from\\nNASA under the Commercial Crew Program program. The\\ncargo variant of Dragon 2 flew for the first time in December\\n2020, for a resupply to the ISS as part of the CRS contract\\nwith NASA.[176]\\n\\nIn March 2020 SpaceX revealed the Dragon XL, designed as SpaceX Dragon 2 spacecraft, designed\\n\\na resupply spacecraft for NASA\\'s planned Lunar Gateway to deliver crew and cargo to and from the\\nInternational Space Station (cargo\\n\\nspace station under a Gateway Logistics Services (GLS) version shown)\\ncontract.[177] Dragon XL is planned to launch on the Falcon\\nHeavy, and is able to transport over 5,000\\xa0kg (11,000\\xa0 lb) to\\nthe Gateway. Dragon XL will be docked at the Gateway for six to twelve months at a time.[178]\\n\\nSpaceX designed a spacesuit to be worn inside the Dragon spacecraft to protect from possible\\ndepressurization.[179] On May 4, 2024, SpaceX unveiled a second spacesuit designed for extravehicular\\nactivity, planned to be used for a spacewalk during the Polaris Dawn mission.[180]\\n\\nAutonomous spaceport drone ships\\nSpaceX routinely returns the first stage of Falcon 9\\nand Falcon Heavy rockets after orbital launches. The\\nrocket lands at a predetermined landing site using\\nonly its propulsion systems.[181] When propellant\\nmargins do not permit a return to a launch site\\n(RTLS), rockets return to a floating landing platform\\nin the ocean, called autonomous spaceport drone ships\\n(ASDS).[182]\\n\\nSpaceX also had plans to introduce floating launch\\nplatforms, which would be modified oil rigs provide a\\nsea launch option for their Starship launch vehicle. As Autonomous spaceport drone ship in position\\n\\nof February 2023, SpaceX had sold the oil rigs, but prior to CRS-6 mission\\n\\nhad not ruled out sea-based platforms for future\\nuse.[183]\\n\\nStarlink\\nStarlink is an internet satellite constellation under development by Starlink Services, LLC, a wholly\\nowned subsidiary of SpaceX,[9][184] that consists of thousands of cross-linked communications satellites\\nin ~550\\xa0km orbits. Its goal is to address the significant unmet demand worldwide for low-cost broadband\\ncapabilities.[185] Development began in 2015, and initial prototype test-flight satellites were launched on\\nthe SpaceX Paz satellite mission in 2017. In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites\\naboard a Falcon 9.[186] Initial test operation of the constellation began in late 2020[187] and first orders\\n\\n\\n\\nwere taken in early 2021.[188] Customers were told to\\nexpect internet service speeds of 50\\xa0 Mbit/s to\\n150\\xa0Mbit/s and latency from 20 ms to 40 ms.[189] In\\nDecember 2022, Starlink reached over 1 million\\nsubscribers worldwide.[190]\\n\\nThe planned large number of Starlink satellites has\\nbeen criticized by astronomers due to concerns over\\nlight pollution,[191][192][193] with the brightness of\\nStarlink satellites in both optical and radio Sixty Starlink satellites stacked together before\\n\\nwavelengths interfering with scientific deployment\\n\\nobservations.[194] In response, SpaceX has\\nimplemented several upgrades to Starlink satellites aimed at reducing their brightness.[195] The large\\nnumber of satellites employed by Starlink also creates long-term dangers of space debris\\ncollisions.[196][197] However, the satellites are equipped with krypton-fueled Hall thrusters which allow\\nthem to de-orbit at the end of their life. They are also designed to autonomously avoid collisions based on\\nuplinked tracking data.[198]\\n\\nIn December 2022, SpaceX announced Starshield, a program to incorporate military or government entity\\npayloads on board a Starlink-derived satellite bus. The Space Development Agency is a key customer\\nprocuring satellites for a space-based missile defense system.[199][200]\\n\\nIn June 2024, SpaceX introduced a compact version of its Starlink antennas, the \"Starlink Mini\",\\ndesigned for mobile satellite internet use. Offered for $599 in an early access release, it was more\\nexpensive than the base model. The Mini antenna, half the size and one-third the weight of the Standard\\nversion, featured a built-in WiFi router, lower power consumption, and over 100 Mbit/s download\\nspeeds.[201]\\n\\nOther projects\\n\\nHyperloop\\nIn June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would sponsor a Hyperloop competition, and would build a\\n1.6\\xa0km (0.99\\xa0mi) long subscale test track near SpaceX\\'s headquarters for the competitive events.[202][203]\\n\\nThe company held the annual competition from 2017 to 2019.[204]\\n\\nCOVID-19 antibody-testing program\\nIn collaboration with doctors and academic researchers, SpaceX invited all employees to participate in\\nthe creation of a COVID-19 antibody-testing program in 2020. As such, 4300 employees volunteered to\\nprovide blood samples resulting in a peer-reviewed scientific paper crediting eight SpaceX employees as\\ncoauthors and suggesting that a certain level of COVID-19 antibodies may provide lasting protection\\nagainst the virus.[205][206]\\n\\n\\n\\nOther\\nIn July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children\\nstuck in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[207] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team,\\nencouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened.\\nHowever, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk\\'s\\ninvolvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\".[208][209] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company\\nbuilt the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally\\ndelivered it to Thailand.[210][211] Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it\\nwasn\\'t practical for the rescue mission.[207]\\n\\nFacilities\\nSpaceX is headquartered at the SpaceX Starbase near Brownsville, Texas, where it manufactures and\\nlaunches its Starship vehicle. However most of the company\\'s operations are based out of its office in\\nHawthorne, California where it was previously headquartered, where it builds Falcon rockets and Dragon\\nspacecraft, and where it houses its mission control.\\n\\nThe company also operates a Starlink satellite manufacturing facilities in Redmond, Washington, a rocket\\ndevelopment and test facility in McGregor, Texas,[212] and maintains an office in the Washington, D.C.\\narea, close to key government customers.[213]\\n\\nSpaceX has two active launch sites in Florida, one active launch site in California and one active launch\\nsite at Starbase in Texas.\\n\\nHawthorne, CA: Falcon and Dragon manufacturing, mission control\\nSpaceX operates a large facility in the Los Angeles\\nsuburb of Hawthorne, California. The three-story\\nbuilding, originally built by Northrop Corporation to\\nbuild Boeing 747 fuselages,[214] houses SpaceX\\'s\\noffice space, mission control, and Falcon 9\\nmanufacturing facilities.[215]\\n\\nThe area has one of the largest concentrations of\\nspace sector headquarters, facilities, and subsidiaries\\nin the U.S., including Boeing/McDonnell Douglas\\nmain satellite building campuses, The Aerospace SpaceX office in Hawthorne, California at night\\nCorporation, Raytheon, NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion during a Falcon 9 launch from Vandenberg Space\\n\\nLaboratory, United States Space Force\\'s Space Force Base\\n\\nSystems Command at Los Angeles Air Force Base,\\nLockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, and AECOM, etc., with a large pool of aerospace\\nengineers and recent college engineering graduates.[214]\\n\\nSpaceX uses a high degree of vertical integration in the production of its rockets and rocket engines.[19]\\n\\nSpaceX builds its rocket engines, rocket stages, spacecraft, principal avionics and all software in-house in\\ntheir Hawthorne facility, which is unusual for the space industry.[19]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hawthorne facility was SpaceX\\'s headquarters until August 2024. However, the move to relocate\\nSpaceX\\'s headquarters was seen as largely symbolic, at least in the short term, as the facility will remain\\nto the company\\'s operations.[216]\\n\\nStarbase, TX: Starship manufacturing, launch\\nSpaceX manufactures and flies Starship test vehicles from the\\nSpaceX Starbase in Boca Chica near Brownsville, Texas,\\nhaving announced first plans for the launch facility in August\\n2014.[217][218] The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\\nissued the permit in July 2014.[219] SpaceX broke ground on\\nthe new launch facility in 2014 with construction ramping up\\nin the latter half of 2015,[220] with the first suborbital\\nlaunches from the facility in 2019[215] and orbital launches\\nstarting in 2023.\\n\\nThe Starship assembly building at\\nSpaceX has faced increased scrutiny over the environmental SpaceX Starbase in Texas\\nimpact of its Starbase facility.[221][222][223] In August 2024,\\nthe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality cited\\nSpaceX for violating environmental regulations by repeatedly releasing pollutants into water near the\\nBoca Chica launch site.[224] The EPA fined SpaceX approximately $150,000 for allegedly discharging\\n\"industrial wastewater\" and violating the Clean Water Act.[225]\\n\\nMcGregor, TX: Rocket Development and Test Facility\\nSpaceX\\'s Rocket Development and Test Facility in\\nMcGregor, Texas is a rocket engine test facility. Every\\nrocket engine and thruster manufactured by SpaceX\\nmust pass through McGregor for final testing being\\nused on flight missions.[226][227] The facility also\\nserves as a testing ground for various components and\\nengines during the research and development\\nprocess.[228] In addition to engine testing, after\\nsplashdown and recovery, Dragon spacecraft make a\\nstop at McGregor to have their hazardous hypergolic\\npropellant fuels removed, before the capsules Aerial view of the SpaceX McGregor engine\\n\\ncontinue on to Hawthorne for refurbishment.[226] testing facility, 2008\\n\\nSpaceX calls the facility the most advanced and active\\nrocket engine test facility in the world, and said that as of 2024, over 7,000 tests had been conducted at\\nthe facility since it opened, with seven engine test fires on a typical day, across more than a dozen test\\nstands.[229] Despite its low-profile compared to the company\\'s other facilities, is a critical part of\\nSpaceX\\'s operations, and company president and COO Gwynne Shotwell maintains her primary office in\\nMcGregor.[230][226]\\n\\n\\n\\nOriginally the site of the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant during World War II,[228] the facility was later used\\nby Beal Aerospace before being leased by SpaceX in 2003.[231] The company has since expanded it\\nsignificantly from 256 acres (104\\xa0ha) in 2003[228] to 4,000 acres (1,600\\xa0ha) by 2015.[229] In July 2021,\\nSpaceX announced plans to build a second production facility for Raptor engines at McGregor.

The former Launch Complex 13 at Cape Canaveral, now renamed Landing Zones 1\\n\\n\\n\\nand 2, has since 2015 been used for Falcon 9 first-stage booster landings.[243] Later on, SpaceX will retire\\nthese two landing zones and add three landing zones for Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets to conduct to\\n\"Return-to-launch-site\" landings, two at LC-39A and one at SLC-40.[244][245][246]\\n\\nVandenberg Space Launch Complex 4 (SLC-4E) was leased\\nfrom the military in 2011 and is used for payloads to polar\\norbits. The Vandenberg site can launch both Falcon 9 and\\nFalcon Heavy vehicles,[247] but cannot launch to low\\ninclination orbits. The neighboring SLC-4W was converted to\\nLanding Zone 4 in 2015 for booster landings.[248]\\n\\nOn April 14, 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease for\\nKennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A.[249] The pad\\nwas subsequently modified to support Falcon 9 and Falcon SpaceX west coast launch facility at\\n\\nVandenberg Space Force Base, during\\nHeavy launches. As of 2024 it is the only pad that supports the launch of CASSIOPE\\nFalcon Heavy launches. SpaceX launched its first crewed\\nmission to the ISS from Launch Pad 39A on May 30,\\n2020.[250] Pad 39A has been prepared since 2019 to eventually accommodate Starship launches. With\\ndelays in launch FAA permits for Boca Chica, Texas, the 39A Starship preparation was accelerated in\\n2022.[251]\\n\\nContracts\\nSpaceX won demonstration and actual supply contracts from NASA for the International Space Station\\n(ISS) with technology the company developed. SpaceX is also certified for U.S. military launches of\\nEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle-class (EELV) payloads. With approximately thirty missions on the\\nmanifest for 2018 alone, SpaceX represented over $12\\xa0billion under contract.[70]\\n\\nCargo to ISS\\nIn 2006, SpaceX won a NASA Commercial Orbital\\nTransportation Services (COTS) Phase 1 contract to\\ndemonstrate cargo delivery to the ISS, with a possible\\ncontract option for crew transport.[252] Through this contract,\\ndesigned by NASA to provide \"seed money\" through Space\\nAct Agreements for developing new capabilities, NASA paid\\nSpaceX $396\\xa0 million to develop the cargo configuration of\\nthe Dragon spacecraft, while SpaceX developed the Falcon 9\\nlaunch vehicle with their resources.[253] These Space Act\\nAgreements have been shown to have saved NASA millions\\nof dollars in development costs, making rocket development The COTS 2 Dragon is berthed to the\\n4–10 times less expensive than if produced by NASA International Space Station (ISS) by\\nalone.[254] Canadarm2\\n\\n\\n\\nIn December 2010, with the launch of the SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 1 mission, SpaceX became the\\nfirst private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft.[255] Dragon successfully\\nberthed with the ISS during SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 2 in May 2012, a first for a private\\nspacecraft.[256]\\n\\nCommercial Resupply Services (CRS) is a series of contracts awarded by NASA from 2008 to 2016 for\\nthe delivery of cargo and supplies to the ISS on commercially operated spacecraft. The first CRS\\ncontracts were signed in 2008 and awarded $1.6\\xa0 billion to SpaceX for 12 cargo transport missions,\\ncovering deliveries to 2016.[257] SpaceX CRS-1, the first of the 12 planned resupply missions, launched\\nin October 2012, achieved orbit, berthed, and remained on station for 20 days, before re-entering the\\natmosphere and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.[258]\\n\\nCRS missions have flown approximately twice a year to the ISS since then. In 2015, NASA extended the\\nPhase 1 contracts by ordering an additional three resupply flights from SpaceX, and then extended the\\ncontract further for a total of twenty cargo missions to the ISS.[259][257][260] The final Dragon 1 mission,\\nSpaceX CRS-20, departed the ISS in April 2020, and Dragon was subsequently retired from service. A\\nsecond phase of contracts was awarded in January 2016 with SpaceX as one of the awardees. SpaceX will\\nfly up to nine additional CRS flights with the upgraded Dragon 2 spacecraft.[261][262] In March 2020,\\nNASA contracted SpaceX to develop the Dragon XL spacecraft to send supplies to the Lunar Gateway\\nspace station. Dragon XL will be launched on a Falcon Heavy.[263]\\n\\nCrewed\\nSpaceX is responsible for the transportation of NASA\\nastronauts to and from the ISS. The NASA contracts\\nstarted as part of the Commercial Crew Development\\n(CCDev) program, aimed at developing commercially\\noperated spacecraft capable of delivering astronauts to\\nthe ISS. The first contract was awarded to SpaceX in\\n2011,[264][265] followed by another in 2012 to\\ncontinue development and testing of its Dragon 2\\nspacecraft.[266]\\n\\nIn September 2014, NASA chose SpaceX and Boeing NASA astronauts inside the Dragon spacecraft\\nas the two companies that would be funded to develop during the Crew-1 mission rendezvous with the\\nsystems to transport U.S. crews to and from the International Space Station\\n\\nISS.[267] SpaceX won $2.6\\xa0 billion to complete and\\ncertify Dragon 2 by 2017. The contracts called for at least one crewed flight test with at least one NASA\\nastronaut aboard. Once Crew Dragon received NASA human-spaceflight certification, the contract\\nrequired SpaceX to conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station.[267]\\n\\nSpaceX completed the first key flight test of its Crew Dragon spacecraft, a Pad Abort Test, in May\\n2015,[268] and successfully conducted a full uncrewed test flight in early 2019. The capsule docked to the\\nISS and then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean.[269] In January 2020, SpaceX conducted an in-flight\\nabort test, the last test flight before flying crew, in which the Dragon spacecraft fired its launch escape\\nengines in a simulated abort scenario.[270]\\n\\n\\n\\nOn May 30, 2020, the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission was launched to the International Space Station\\nwith NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, the first time a crewed vehicle had launched from\\nthe U.S. since 2011, and the first SpaceX commercial crewed launch to the ISS.[271] The Crew-1 mission\\nwas successfully launched to the International Space Station on November 16, 2020, with NASA\\nastronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker along with JAXA astronaut Soichi\\nNoguchi,[272] all members of the Expedition 64 crew.[273] On April 23, 2021, Crew-2 was launched to the\\nInternational Space Station with NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and K. Megan McArthur, JAXA\\nastronaut Akihiko Hoshide, and ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet.[274] The Crew-2 mission successfully\\ndocked on April 24, 2021.[275]\\n\\nSpaceX also offers paid crewed spaceflights for\\nprivate individuals. The first of these missions,\\nInspiration4, launched in 2021 on behalf of Shift4\\nPayments CEO Jared Isaacman. The mission launched\\nthe Crew Dragon Resilience from the Florida\\nKennedy Space Center\\'s Launch Complex 39A atop a\\nFalcon 9 launch vehicle, placed the Dragon capsule\\ninto low Earth orbit, and ended successfully about\\nthree days later when the Resilience splashed down in\\nthe Atlantic Ocean. All four crew members received Resilience after splashdown\\ncommercial astronaut training from SpaceX. The\\ntraining included lessons in orbital mechanics,\\noperating in a microgravity environment, stress testing, emergency-preparedness training, and mission\\nsimulations.[276]\\n\\nNational defense\\nIn 2005, SpaceX announced that it had been awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)\\ncontract, allowing the United States Air Force to purchase up to $100\\xa0million worth of launches from the\\ncompany.[277] Three years later, NASA announced that it had awarded an IDIQ Launch Services contract\\nto SpaceX for up to $1\\xa0billion, depending on the number of missions awarded.[278] In December 2012,\\nSpaceX announced its first two launch contracts with the United States Department of Defense (DoD).\\nThe United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center awarded SpaceX two EELV-class\\nmissions: Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and Space Test Program 2 (STP-2). DSCOVR\\nwas launched on a Falcon 9 launch vehicle in 2015, while STP-2 was launched on a Falcon Heavy on\\nJune 25, 2019.[279]\\n\\nThe Falcon 9 v1.1 was certified for National Security Space Launch (NSSL) in 2015, allowing SpaceX to\\ncontract launch services to the Air Force for any payloads classified under national security.[161] This\\nbroke the monopoly held since 2006 by United Launch Alliance (ULA) over U.S. Air Force launches of\\nclassified payloads.[280] In April 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded the first such national security launch\\nto SpaceX to launch the second GPS III satellite for $82.7\\xa0million.[281] This was approximately 40% less\\nthan the estimated cost for similar previous missions.[282] SpaceX also launched the third GPS III launch\\non June 20, 2020.[283] In March 2018, SpaceX secured an additional $290\\xa0million contract from the U.S.\\nAir Force to launch another three GPS III satellites.[284]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) also\\npurchased launches from SpaceX, with the first taking\\nplace on May 1, 2017.[285] In February 2019, SpaceX\\nsecured a $297\\xa0 million contract from the U.S. Air\\nForce to launch another three national security\\nmissions, all slated to launch no earlier than FY\\n2021.[286] In August 2020, the U.S. Space Force\\nawarded its National Security Space Launch (NSSL)\\ncontracts for the following 5–7 years. SpaceX won a\\ncontract for $316\\xa0million for one launch. In addition,\\nSpaceX will handle 40% of the U.S. military\\'s\\nsatellite launch requirements over the period.[287]\\n\\nSpaceX also designs and launches custom military\\nsatellites for the Space Development Agency as part\\nof a new missile defense system in low Earth\\norbit.[288] The constellation would give the United\\nStates capabilities to sense, target and potentially\\nintercept nuclear missiles and hypersonic weapons\\nlaunched from anywhere on Earth.[289] Both China\\nand Russia brought concerns to the United Nations\\nabout the program,[290] and various organizations\\nwarn it could be destabilizing and trigger an arms race Launch of the STP-2 mission on a Falcon Heavy\\n\\nin space.[291][292] in June 2019\\n\\nIn March 2024, Reuters reported that, as part of a\\n$1.8 billion contract signed with the National Reconnaissance Office in 2021, SpaceX is building a\\nnetwork of hundreds of spy satellites. This new network, Reuters reported, would be able to operate as a\\nswarm in low orbits.[293]\\n\\nIn December 2024, WSJ reported that Musk didn\\'t have access to government secrets.[294]\\n\\nLaunch market competition and pricing pressure\\nSpaceX\\'s low launch prices, especially for communications satellites flying to geostationary transfer orbit\\n(GTO), have resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their own prices.[19] Prior to 2013,\\nthe openly competed comsat launch market had been dominated by Arianespace (flying the Ariane 5) and\\nInternational Launch Services (flying the Proton).[295] With a published price of $56.5\\xa0million per launch\\nto low Earth orbit, Falcon 9 rockets were the least expensive in the industry.[296] European satellite\\noperators are pushing the ESA to reduce launch prices of the Ariane 5 and Ariane 6 rockets as a result of\\ncompetition from SpaceX.[297]\\n\\nSpaceX ended the United Launch Alliance (ULA) monopoly of U.S. military payloads when it began to\\ncompete for national security launches. In 2015, anticipating a slump in domestic, military, and spy\\nlaunches, ULA stated that it would go out of business unless it won commercial satellite launch\\n\\n\\n\\norders.[298] To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease\\nlaunch costs by half.[299][300]\\n\\nCongressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggested that the NASA Space Act Agreement process of\\n\"setting only a high-level requirement for cargo transport to the space station [while] leaving the details to\\nindustry\" had allowed SpaceX to design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at a substantially\\nlower cost. According to NASA\\'s own independently verified numbers, SpaceX\\'s total development cost\\nfor the Falcon 9 rocket, including the Falcon 1 rocket, was estimated at $390\\xa0million. In 2011, NASA\\nestimated that it would have cost the agency about $4\\xa0billion to develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster\\nbased upon NASA\\'s traditional contracting processes, about ten times more.[254] In May 2020, NASA\\nadministrator Jim Bridenstine remarked that thanks to NASA\\'s investments into SpaceX, the United\\nStates has 70% of the commercial launch market, a major improvement since 2012 when there were no\\ncommercial launches from the country.[301]\\n\\nAs of 2024, SpaceX operates a Rideshare and Bandwagon (mid inclination) programs. This provides\\nadditional competition for small satellite launchers.[302]\\n\\n\\n\\nCorporate affairs\\n\\nBusiness trends\\n\\nYear Revenue Valuation\\n(billion USD) (billion USD) Number of employees\\n\\n2002 ca. 30[303]\\n\\n2003\\n\\n2004\\n\\n2005 ca. 90 (Feb.)[304]\\n\\nca. 160 (Nov.)[305]\\n\\n2006\\n\\n2007 ca. 350 (Aug.)[306]\\n\\n2008 ca. 600 (Dec.)[307]\\n\\n2009 > 800 (Dec.)[308]\\n\\n2010 > 1,000 (June)[309]\\n\\n2011 ca. 1,300 (Jan.)[310]\\n\\n2012 2.4 (June)[311] ca. 1,800 (May)[312]\\n\\n2013 ca. 3,800 (Oct.)[313]\\n\\n2014 10 (Aug.)[314]\\n\\n2015 12 (Jan.)[315]\\n\\n2016 15 (Nov.)[316] ca. 5,000 (Nov.)[317]\\n\\n2017 21 (Nov.)[318] ca. 7,000 (Nov.)[319]\\n\\n2018 27 (Apr.)[320]\\n\\n2019 33 (May)[321] > 6,000 (July)[322]\\n\\n2020 1.8[323] 46 (Aug.)[324]\\n\\n2021 2.3[323] 74 (Feb.)[324]\\n\\n100 (Oct.)[324] > 9,500 (March)[325]\\n\\n2022 4.6[326] 127 (Aug.)[327] ca.\\xa012,000\\xa0(April)[328]\\n\\n2023 \\xa09[329] 137\\xa0(Jan.)[330]\\n\\n180\\xa0(Dec.)[331] >\\xa013,000\\xa0(Sept.)[332]\\n\\n2024 \\xa013.1[4] 350 (Dec.)[324] \\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n2025 ca.\\xa015.5[333] ca.\\xa0400\\xa0(July)[334] \\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBoard of directors\\n\\nSpaceX board of directors as of January 2021[335]\\n\\nJoined\\nboard Name Titles\\n\\n2002[336] Founder, chairman, CEO and CTO of SpaceX; CEO, Product Architect, and\\nElon Musk\\n\\nformer chairman of Tesla; former chairman of SolarCity[336]\\n\\n2002[337] Kimbal Musk Board member, Tesla[338]\\n\\nGwynne\\nShotwell President and COO of SpaceX[340]\\n\\n2009[339] Luke Nosek Co-founder, PayPal[341]\\n\\nSteve\\nJurvetson Co-founder, Future Ventures fund[342]\\n\\n2010[343] Antonio\\nGracias CEO and Chairman of the Investment Committee at Valor Equity Partners[344]\\n\\n2015[345] Donald\\nHarrison President of global partnerships and corporate development, Google[346]\\n\\nLeadership changes\\nIn November 2022, the company announced COO Gwynne Shotwell and vice president Mark Juncosa\\nwould oversee Starbase, its Texas launch facility, along with Omead Afshar, who at the time oversaw\\noperations for Tesla in Texas. Shyamal Patel, who was senior director of operations at the site, would shift\\nto its Cape Canaveral site. CNBC reported that these executive moves demonstrated \"the sense of urgency\\nwithin the company to get Starship flying\".[347][348][349]\\n\\nWorkplace culture\\n\\nAccording to former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver, the company overall has a male-dominated\\nemployee culture, similar to that of the spaceflight industry in general.[350] In December 2021, claims of\\nworkplace sexual harassment from five former SpaceX employees, ranging from interns to full engineers,\\nwere published.[351] The former employees claimed to have experienced unwanted advances and\\nuncomfortable interactions.[352] Additionally, the accounts included claims of a culture of sexual\\nharassment existing at the company and one where complaints made to executives, managers, and human\\nresources officers went largely unaddressed.[353]\\n\\nIn May 2022, a Business Insider article alleged that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct with a SpaceX\\nflight attendant in a private jet in 2016 citing an anonymous friend of the flight attendant.[354] In\\nresponse, some employees collaborated on an open letter condemning \"Elon\\'s harmful Twitter\\nbehavior\".[355] It also asks the company to clearly define SpaceX\\'s \"no-asshole\" and \"zero tolerance\"\\npolicies, which it says is unequally enforced from one employee to the next. The next day, Gwynne\\nShotwell announced that those employees who were involved with the letter had been terminated and\\nclaimed that unsponsored, unsolicited surveys were sent to employees during the work day and that some\\nfelt pressured to sign the letter.[356]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe company has also been described as having a work culture that pushes employees to work\\nexcessively and is described as fostering a burnout culture.[357] According to a memo by Blue Origin, a\\nrival aerospace company with a history of lawsuits and anti-SpaceX political lobbying,[358][359][360]\\n\\nSpaceX expected very long work hours, work on weekends, and limited use of holidays.[357]\\n\\n\"SpaceX employees say they’re paying the price for the billionaire’s push to colonize space at breakneck\\nspeed\" reported Reuters in 2023. An examination of OSHA\\'s records revealed injury rates higher than the\\nindustry\\'s averages. In addition, Reuters documented at least 600 previously unreported workplace\\ninjuries at SpaceX, including \"crushed limbs, amputations, electrocutions, head and eye wounds and one\\ndeath.\"[361] [362] The person who died was Lonnie LeBlanc, a former United States Marine.\\n\\nIn June 2024, eight ex-employees, the same who had previously been fired for penning the open letter\\nagainst Elon Musk, filed a lawsuit against Musk and SpaceX alleging sexual harassment and\\ndiscrimination.[363][364][365] The lawsuit has since stalled on headquarter jurisdiction grounds. [366][367]\\n\\nFederal investigations\\nIn August 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit against SpaceX for discriminating\\nagainst refugees and asylum seekers in its hiring process, alleging that the company violated the\\nImmigration and Nationality Act by rejecting refugees and asylum recipients and hiring only U.S. citizens\\nand permanent residents.[368] SpaceX denied wrongdoing, citing U.S. export control law.[369] In February\\n2025, the DOJ filed a motion to dismiss the case with prejudice.[369][370]\\n\\nIn December 2024, federal agencies investigated SpaceX for security violations as well as Musk\\'s alleged\\ndrug use.[371][372]\\n\\nEnvironmental impact\\nAccording to an investigation conducted by NPR, \"SpaceX has sometimes ignored environmental\\nregulations as it rushed to fulfill its founder’s vision. With each of its launches, records show, the\\ncompany discharged tens of thousands of gallons of what regulators classify as industrial wastewater into\\nthe surrounding environment.\"[373] In addition to endangering nearby people, the wastewater poses\\nsignificant threats to wildlife.[374]\\n\\nThe 2025 SpaceX Starship Flight 7 rocket explosion sent debris into the atmosphere that was spread\\nacross the Caribbean Sea. The incident also \"released significant amounts of harmful air pollution into the\\nupper layers of Earth\\'s atmosphere.\"[375]\\n\\nReferences\\n1. \"Delaware Business Search (File # 3500808\\xa0– Space Exploration Technologies Corp)\" (http\\n\\ns://icis.corp.delaware.gov/eCorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx).

Huang\\'s wife, home to the company through most of its\\nLori, did not want him to resign from LSI unless pre-AI period (still in use)\\nMalachowsky resigned from Sun at the same time, and\\nMalachowsky\\'s wife, Melody, felt the same way about\\n\\n\\n\\nHuang.[30] Priem broke that deadlock by resigning first from\\nSun, effective December 31, 1992.[30] According to Priem,\\nthis put pressure on Huang and Malachowsky to not leave\\nhim to \"flail alone\", so they gave notice too.[31] Huang left\\nLSI and \"officially joined Priem on February 17\", which was\\nalso Huang\\'s 30th birthday, while Malachowsky left Sun in\\nearly March.[31] In early 1993, the three founders began\\nworking together on their new startup in Priem\\'s townhouse\\nin Fremont, California.[32]\\n\\nWith $40,000 in the bank, the company was born.[29] The\\ncompany subsequently received $20 million of venture capital\\nfunding from Sequoia Capital, Sutter Hill Ventures and\\nothers.[33]\\n\\nDuring the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 startup\\ncompanies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for Aerial view of Endeavor, the first of the\\n\\ntwo new Nvidia headquarters buildings, in\\nvideo games was the path to the future.[25] Only two Santa Clara, California, in 2017\\nsurvived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which\\nmerged into AMD.[25]\\n\\nNvidia initially had no name.[34] Priem\\'s first idea was\\n\"Primal Graphics\", a syllabic abbreviation of two of the\\nfounders\\' last names, but that left out Huang.[34] They soon\\ndiscovered it was impossible to create a workable name with\\nsyllables from all three founders\\' names, after considering\\n\"Huaprimal\", \"Prihuamal\", \"Malluapri\", etc.[34] The next idea\\ncame from Priem\\'s idea for the name of Nvidia\\'s first\\nproduct.[34] Priem originally wanted to call it the \"GXNV\", as Entrance of Endeavor headquarters\\n\\nbuilding in 2018\\nin the \"next version\" of the GX graphics chips which he had\\nworked on at Sun.[32] Then Huang told Priem to \"drop the\\nGX\", resulting in the name \"NV\".[32] Priem made a list of words with the letters \"NV\" in them.[34] At one\\npoint, Malachowsky and Priem wanted to call the company NVision, but that name was already taken by\\na manufacturer of toilet paper.[26] Both Priem[34] and Huang have taken credit for coming up with the\\nname Nvidia,[26] from \"invidia\", the Latin word for \"envy\".[29]\\n\\nAfter the company outgrew Priem\\'s townhouse, its original headquarters office was in Sunnyvale,\\nCalifornia.[29]\\n\\nFirst graphics accelerator\\nNvidia\\'s first graphics accelerator, the NV1, was designed to process quadrilateral primitives (forward\\ntexture mapping), a feature that set it apart from competitors, who preferred triangle primitives.[26]\\n\\nHowever, when Microsoft introduced the DirectX platform, it chose not to support any other graphics\\nsoftware and announced that its Direct3D API would exclusively support triangles.[26][35] As a result, the\\nNV1 failed to gain traction in the market.[36]\\n\\n\\n\\nNvidia had also entered into a partnership with Sega to supply the graphics chip for the Dreamcast\\nconsole and worked on the project for about a year. However, Nvidia\\'s technology was already lagging\\nbehind competitors. This placed the company in a difficult position: continue working on a chip that was\\nlikely doomed to fail or abandon the project, risking financial collapse.[37]\\n\\nIn a pivotal moment, Sega\\'s president, Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that\\nSega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia\\'s\\npotential and persuaded Sega\\'s management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected\\nthat this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri\\'s \"understanding and generosity gave us\\nsix months to live\".[37]\\n\\nIn 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia\\'s employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to\\n40—and focused the company\\'s remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product\\noptimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128.[26][35] By the time the RIVA 128 was\\nreleased in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month\\'s payroll.[26] The sense of\\nimpending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia\\'s unofficial company motto: \"Our\\ncompany is thirty days from going out of business.\"[26] Huang began internal presentations to Nvidia staff\\nwith those words for many years.[26]\\n\\nNvidia sold about a million RIVA 128 units within four months,[26] and used the revenue to fund\\ndevelopment of its next generation of products.[35] In 1998, the release of the RIVA TNT helped solidify\\nNvidia\\'s reputation as a leader in graphics technology.[38]\\n\\nPublic company\\nNvidia went public on January 22, 1999.[39][40][41] Investing in Nvidia after it had already failed to\\ndeliver on its contract turned out to be Irimajiri\\'s best decision as Sega\\'s president. After Irimajiri left\\nSega in 2000, Sega sold its Nvidia stock for $15 million.[37]\\n\\nIn late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU,\\nwhich was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level\\n3D hardware. Running at 120\\xa0MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video\\nacceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed\\nexisting products by a wide margin.\\n\\nDue to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for\\nMicrosoft\\'s Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project took\\nmany of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the\\nGeForce 2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000. In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to\\nacquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology\\nleading the field from the mid-1990s until 2000.[42][43] The acquisition process was finalized in April\\n2002.[44]\\n\\nIn 2001, Standard & Poor\\'s selected Nvidia to replace the departing Enron in the S&P 500 stock index,\\nmeaning that index funds would need to hold Nvidia shares going forward.[45]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software-rendering tools and\\nthe personnel were merged into the Cg project.[46] In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for\\napproximately US$70 million.[47] It launched GoForce the following year. On April 22, 2004, Nvidia\\nacquired iReady, also a provider of high-performance TCP offload engines and iSCSI controllers.[48] In\\nDecember 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics\\nprocessor (RSX) for the PlayStation 3 game console. On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI\\nElectronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia\\'s\\ncompetitor.[49] In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[50] In December 2006, Nvidia, along\\nwith its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the\\nU.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[51]\\n\\n2007–2014\\nForbes named Nvidia its Company of the Year for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the\\nsaid period as well as during the previous five years.[52] On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it\\nhad completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc.[53] In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia,\\ndeveloper of PhysX, a physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to\\nintegrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.[54][55]\\n\\nIn July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after\\nreporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had \"abnormal failure rates\"\\ndue to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008,\\nNvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had\\nbeen incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September\\n2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs\\nor, in some cases, replacement.[56][57] On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-\\nlicensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.[58]\\n\\nIn November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its ARM-based\\nsystem on a chip for mobile devices, Tegra 3. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-\\ncore mobile CPU.[59][60] In May 2011, it was announced that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Icera, a\\nbaseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million.[61] In January 2013, Nvidia unveiled the\\nTegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new\\nsystem on a chip.[62] On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from\\nSTMicroelectronics.[63]\\n\\nIn February 2013, Nvidia announced its plans to build a new headquarters in the form of two giant\\ntriangle-shaped buildings on the other side of San Tomas Expressway (to the west of its existing\\nheadquarters complex). The company selected triangles as its design theme. As Huang explained in a\\nblog post, the triangle is \"the fundamental building block of computer graphics\".[64]\\n\\nIn 2014, Nvidia ported the Valve games Portal and Half Life 2 to its Nvidia Shield Tablet as Lightspeed\\nStudio.[65][66] Since 2014, Nvidia has diversified its business focusing on three markets: gaming,\\nautomotive electronics, and mobile devices.[67]\\n\\nThat same year, Nvidia also prevailed in litigation brought by the trustee of 3dfx\\'s bankruptcy estate to\\nchallenge its 2000 acquisition of 3dfx\\'s intellectual assets. On November 6, 2014, in an unpublished\\nmemorandum order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the \"district court\\'s\\n\\n\\n\\njudgment affirming the bankruptcy court\\'s determination that [Nvidia] did not pay less than fair market\\nvalue for assets purchased from 3dfx shortly before 3dfx filed for bankruptcy\".[68]\\n\\n2016–2018\\nOn May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GPUs of the GeForce 10 series, the GTX 1080 and 1070,\\nbased on the company\\'s new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its\\nMaxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and\\nuse a 16\\xa0 nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as\\nsimultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and\\nvirtual reality (VR) rendering.[69][70][71] Laptops that include these GPUs and are sufficiently thin\\xa0– as of\\nlate 2017, under 0.8 inches (20\\xa0 mm)\\xa0 – have been designated as meeting Nvidia\\'s \"Max-Q\" design\\nstandard.[72]\\n\\nIn July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model,\\nas the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4\\xa0GB of VRAM due to limitations brought by the\\ndesign of its hardware.[73] In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota which would use\\nNvidia\\'s Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles.[74] In July 2017,\\nNvidia and Chinese search giant Baidu announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud\\ncomputing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu\\'s open-source AI framework\\nPaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that Nvidia\\'s Drive PX 2 AI will be the foundation of its autonomous-\\nvehicle platform.[75]\\n\\nNvidia officially released the Titan V on December 7, 2017.[76][77]\\n\\nNvidia officially released the Nvidia Quadro GV100 on March 27, 2018.[78] Nvidia officially released the\\nRTX 2080 GPUs on September 27, 2018. In 2018, Google announced that Nvidia\\'s Tesla P4 graphic\\ncards would be integrated into Google Cloud service\\'s artificial intelligence.[79]\\n\\nIn May 2018, on the Nvidia user forum, a thread was started[80] asking the company to update users when\\nthey would release web drivers for its cards installed on legacy Mac Pro machines up to mid-2012 5,1\\nrunning the macOS Mojave operating system 10.14. Web drivers are required to enable graphics\\nacceleration and multiple display monitor capabilities of the GPU. On its Mojave update info website,\\nApple stated that macOS Mojave would run on legacy machines with \\'Metal compatible\\' graphics\\ncards[81] and listed Metal compatible GPUs, including some manufactured by Nvidia.[82] However, this\\nlist did not include Metal compatible cards that currently work in macOS High Sierra using Nvidia-\\ndeveloped web drivers. In September, Nvidia responded, \"Apple fully controls drivers for macOS. But if\\nApple allows, our engineers are ready and eager to help Apple deliver great drivers for macOS 10.14\\n(Mojave).\"[83] In October, Nvidia followed this up with another public announcement, \"Apple fully\\ncontrols drivers for macOS. Unfortunately, Nvidia currently cannot release a driver unless it is approved\\nby Apple,\"[84] suggesting a possible rift between the two companies.[85] By January 2019, with still no\\nsign of the enabling web drivers, Apple Insider weighed into the controversy with a claim that Apple\\nmanagement \"doesn\\'t want Nvidia support in macOS\".[86] The following month, Apple Insider followed\\nthis up with another claim that Nvidia support was abandoned because of \"relational issues in the\\npast\",[87] and that Apple was developing its own GPU technology.[88] Without Apple-approved Nvidia\\nweb drivers, Apple users are faced with replacing their Nvidia cards with a competing supported brand,\\nsuch as AMD Radeon from the list recommended by Apple.[89]\\n\\n\\n\\n2019 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies\\nOn March 11, 2019, Nvidia announced a deal to buy\\nMellanox Technologies for $6.9 billion[90] to substantially\\nexpand its footprint in the high-performance computing\\nmarket. In May 2019, Nvidia announced new RTX Studio\\nlaptops. The creators say that the new laptop is going to be\\nseven times faster than a top-end MacBook Pro with a Core i9\\nand AMD\\'s Radeon Pro Vega 20 graphics in apps like Maya\\nand RedCine-X Pro.[91] In August 2019, Nvidia announced\\nMinecraft RTX, an official Nvidia-developed patch for the\\ngame Minecraft adding real-time DXR ray tracing exclusively Nvidia Yokneam office (former Mellanox\\nto the Windows 10 version of the game. The whole game is, Technologies) in Yokneam Illit, Israel, in\\nin Nvidia\\'s words, \"refit\" with path tracing, which March 2023\\ndramatically affects the way light, reflections, and shadows\\nwork inside the engine.[92]\\n\\n2020–2023\\nIn May 2020, Nvidia announced it was acquiring Cumulus Networks.[93] Post acquisition the company\\nwas absorbed into Nvidia\\'s networking business unit, along with Mellanox.\\n\\nIn May 2020, Nvidia\\'s developed an open-source ventilator to address the shortage resulting from the\\nglobal coronavirus pandemic.[94] On May 14, 2020, Nvidia officially announced their Ampere GPU\\nmicroarchitecture and the Nvidia A100 GPU accelerator.[95][96] In July 2020, it was reported that Nvidia\\nwas in talks with SoftBank to buy Arm, a UK-based chip designer, for $32 billion.[97]\\n\\nOn September 1, 2020, Nvidia officially announced the GeForce 30 series based on the company\\'s new\\nAmpere microarchitecture.[98][99]\\n\\nOn September 13, 2020, Nvidia announced that they would buy Arm from SoftBank Group for $40\\nbillion, subject to the usual scrutiny, with the latter retaining a 10% share of Nvidia.[100][101][102][103]\\n\\nIn October 2020, Nvidia announced its plan to build the most\\npowerful computer in Cambridge, England. The computer,\\ncalled Cambridge-1, launched in July 2021 with a $100\\nmillion investment and will employ AI to support healthcare\\nresearch.[104][105] According to Jensen Huang, \"The\\nCambridge-1 supercomputer will serve as a hub of innovation\\nfor the UK, and further the groundbreaking work being done\\nby the nation\\'s researchers in critical healthcare and drug Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, part of the\\ndiscovery.\"[106] RTX 20 series, which is the first\\n\\ngeneration of Nvidia RTX\\nAlso in October 2020, along with the release of the Nvidia\\nRTX A6000, Nvidia announced it is retiring its workstation\\nGPU brand Quadro, shifting its product name to Nvidia RTX for future products and the manufacturing\\nto be Nvidia Ampere architecture-based.[107]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn August 2021, the proposed takeover of Arm was stalled after the UK\\'s Competition and Markets\\nAuthority raised \"significant competition concerns\".[108] In October 2021, the European Commission\\nopened a competition investigation into the takeover. The Commission stated that Nvidia\\'s acquisition\\ncould restrict competitors\\' access to Arm\\'s products and provide Nvidia with too much internal\\ninformation on its competitors due to their deals with Arm. SoftBank (the parent company of Arm) and\\nNvidia announced in early February 2022 that they \"had agreed not to move forward with the transaction\\n\\'because of significant regulatory challenges\\' \".[109] The investigation was set to end on March 15,\\n2022.[110][111] That same month, Nvidia was reportedly compromised by a cyberattack.[112] This would\\nhave been the largest semiconductor acquisition in history.[17][18]\\n\\nIn March 2022, Nvidia\\'s CEO Jensen Huang mentioned that they were open to having Intel manufacture\\ntheir chips in the future.[113] This was the first time the company mentioned that they would work\\ntogether with Intel\\'s upcoming foundry services.\\n\\nIn April 2022, it was reported that Nvidia planned to open a new research center in Yerevan,\\nArmenia.[114]\\n\\nIn May 2022, Nvidia opened Voyager, the second of the two giant buildings at its new headquarters\\ncomplex to the west of the old one. Unlike its smaller and older sibling Endeavor, the triangle theming is\\nused more \"sparingly\" in Voyager.[115][116]\\n\\nIn September 2022, Nvidia announced its next-generation automotive-grade chip, Drive Thor.[117][118]\\n\\nIn September 2022, Nvidia announced a collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard\\nrelated to the entire suite of Nvidia\\'s AI-powered healthcare software suite called Clara, that includes\\nParabricks and MONAI.[119]\\n\\nFollowing U.S. Department of Commerce regulations which placed an embargo on exports to China of\\nadvanced microchips, which went into effect in October 2022, Nvidia saw its data center chip added to\\nthe export control list. The next month, the company unveiled a new advanced chip in China, called the\\nA800 GPU, that met the export control rules.[120]\\n\\nIn September 2023, Getty Images announced that it was partnering with Nvidia to launch Generative AI\\nby Getty Images, a new tool that lets people create images using Getty\\'s library of licensed photos. Getty\\nwill use Nvidia\\'s Edify model, which is available on Nvidia\\'s generative AI model library Picasso.[121]\\n\\nOn September 26, 2023, Denny\\'s CEO Kelli Valade joined Huang in East San Jose to celebrate the\\nfounding of Nvidia at Denny\\'s on Berryessa Road, where a plaque was installed to mark the relevant\\ncorner booth as the birthplace of a $1 trillion company.[26][122] By then, Nvidia\\'s H100 GPUs were in\\nsuch demand that even other tech giants were beholden to how Nvidia allocated supply. Larry Ellison of\\nOracle Corporation said that month that during a dinner with Huang at Nobu in Palo Alto, he and Elon\\nMusk of Tesla, Inc. and xAI \"were begging\" for H100s, \"I guess is the best way to describe it. An hour of\\nsushi and begging\".[123]\\n\\nIn October 2023, it was reported that Nvidia had quietly begun designing ARM-based central processing\\nunits (CPUs) for Microsoft\\'s Windows operating system with a target to start selling them in 2025.[124]\\n\\n\\n\\n2024–2025\\nIn January 2024, Forbes reported that Nvidia has increased its lobbying presence in Washington, D.C. as\\nAmerican lawmakers consider proposals to regulate artificial intelligence. From 2023 to 2024, the\\ncompany reportedly hired at least four government affairs with professional backgrounds at agencies\\nincluding the United States Department of State and the Department of the Treasury. It was noted that the\\n$350,000 spent by the company on lobbying in 2023 was small compared to a number of major tech\\ncompanies in the artificial intelligence space.[125]\\n\\nIn January 2024, Raymond James Financial analysts estimated that Nvidia was selling the H100 GPU in\\nthe price range of $25,000 to $30,000 each, while on eBay, individual H100s cost over $40,000.[126]\\n\\nSeveral major technology companies were purchasing tens or hundreds of thousands of GPUs for their\\ndata centers to run generative artificial intelligence projects; simple arithmetic implied that they were\\ncommitting to billions of dollars in capital expenditures.[126]\\n\\nIn February 2024, it was reported that Nvidia was the \"hot employer\" in Silicon Valley because it was\\noffering interesting work and good pay at a time when other tech employers were downsizing. Half of\\nNvidia employees earned over $228,000 in 2023.[127] By then, Nvidia GPUs had become so valuable that\\nthey needed special security while in transit to data centers. Cisco chief information officer Fletcher\\nPrevin explained at a CIO summit: \"Those GPUs arrive by armored car\".[128]\\n\\nOn March 1, 2024, Nvidia became the third company in the history of the United States to close with a\\nmarket capitalization in excess of $2 trillion.[45] Nvidia needed only 180 days to get to $2 trillion from $1\\ntrillion, while the first two companies, Apple and Microsoft, each took over 500 days.[45] On March 18,\\nNvidia announced its new AI chip and microarchitecture Blackwell, named after mathematician David\\nBlackwell.[129]\\n\\nIn April 2024, Reuters reported that China had allegedly acquired banned Nvidia chips and servers from\\nSupermicro and Dell via tenders.[130]\\n\\nIn June 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department (DOJ) began antitrust\\ninvestigations into Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI, focusing on their influence in the AI industry. The\\nFTC led the investigations into Microsoft and OpenAI, while the DOJ handled Nvidia. The probes\\ncentered on the companies\\' conduct rather than mergers. This development followed an open letter from\\nOpenAI employees expressing concerns about the rapid AI advancements and lack of oversight.[131]\\n\\nThe company became the world\\'s most valuable, surpassing Microsoft and Apple, on June 18, 2024, after\\nits market capitalization exceeded $3.3 trillion.[132][133]\\n\\nIn June 2024, Trend Micro announced a partnership with Nvidia to develop AI-driven security tools,\\nnotably to protect the data centers where AI workloads are processed.

Later that year, AWS\\'s P2 instance was produced\\nusing up to 16 Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs. That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software\\nkit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson,[205] called IBM PowerAI.[206][207] Nvidia also offers its own\\n\\n\\n\\nNvidia Deep Learning software development kit.[208] In 2017, the GPUs were also brought online at the\\nRiken Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu.[209] The company\\'s deep learning technology\\nled to a boost in its 2017 earnings.[210]\\n\\nIn 2018, Nvidia researchers demonstrated imitation-learning techniques for industrial robots.

Neura Robotics, 1X Technologies and Vention are\\namong the first companies to use the model.[217][218][219]\\n\\nInception Program\\nNvidia\\'s Inception Program was created to support startups making exceptional advances in the fields of\\nartificial intelligence and data science. Award winners are announced at Nvidia\\'s GTC Conference. In\\nMay 2017, the program had 1,300 companies.[220] As of March 2018, there were 2,800 startups in the\\nInception Program.[221] As of August 2021, the program has over 8,500 members in 90 countries, with\\ncumulative funding of US$60 billion.[222]\\n\\nControversies\\n\\nMaxwell advertising dispute\\n\\nGTX 970 hardware specifications\\nIssues with the GeForce GTX 970\\'s specifications were first brought up by users when they found out\\nthat the cards, while featuring 4\\xa0 GB of memory, rarely accessed memory over the 3.5\\xa0 GB boundary.\\nFurther testing and investigation eventually led to Nvidia issuing a statement that the card\\'s initially\\nannounced specifications had been altered without notice before the card was made commercially\\navailable, and that the card took a performance hit once memory over the 3.5\\xa0 GB limit were put into\\nuse.[223][224][225]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe card\\'s back-end hardware specifications, initially announced as being identical to those of the\\nGeForce GTX 980, differed in the amount of L2 cache (1.75\\xa0MB versus 2\\xa0MB in the GeForce GTX 980)\\nand the number of ROPs (56 versus 64 in the 980). Additionally, it was revealed that the card was\\ndesigned to access its memory as a 3.5\\xa0GB section, plus a 0.5\\xa0GB one, access to the latter being 7 times\\nslower than the first one.[226] The company then went on to promise a specific driver modification to\\nalleviate the performance issues produced by the cutbacks suffered by the card.[227] However, Nvidia\\nlater clarified that the promise had been a miscommunication and there would be no specific driver\\nupdate for the GTX 970.[228] Nvidia claimed that it would assist customers who wanted refunds in\\nobtaining them.[229] On February 26, 2015, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang went on record in Nvidia\\'s official\\nblog to apologize for the incident.[230] In February 2015 a class-action lawsuit alleging false advertising\\nwas filed against Nvidia and Gigabyte Technology in the U.S. District Court for Northern\\nCalifornia.[231][232]\\n\\nNvidia revealed that it is able to disable individual units, each containing 256\\xa0 KB of L2 cache and 8\\nROPs, without disabling whole memory controllers.[233] This comes at the cost of dividing the memory\\nbus into high speed and low speed segments that cannot be accessed at the same time unless one segment\\nis reading while the other segment is writing because the L2/ROP unit managing both of the GDDR5\\ncontrollers shares the read return channel and the write data bus between the two GDDR5 controllers and\\nitself.[233] This is used in the GeForce GTX 970, which therefore can be described as having 3.5 GB in its\\nhigh speed segment on a 224-bit bus and 0.5 GB in a low speed segment on a 32-bit bus.[233]\\n\\nOn July 27, 2016, Nvidia agreed to a preliminary settlement of the U.S. class action lawsuit,[231] offering\\na $30 refund on GTX 970 purchases. The agreed upon refund represents the portion of the cost of the\\nstorage and performance capabilities the consumers assumed they were obtaining when they purchased\\nthe card.[234]\\n\\nGeForce Partner Program\\nThe Nvidia GeForce Partner Program was a marketing program designed to provide partnering\\ncompanies with benefits such as public relations support, video game bundling, and marketing\\ndevelopment funds.[235] The program proved to be controversial, with complaints about it possibly being\\nan anti-competitive practice.[236]\\n\\nFirst announced in a blog post on March 1, 2018,[237] it was canceled on May 4, 2018.[238]\\n\\nHardware Unboxed\\nOn December 10, 2020, Nvidia told YouTube tech reviewer Steven Walton of Hardware Unboxed that it\\nwould no longer supply him with GeForce Founders Edition graphics card review units.[239][240] In a\\nTwitter message, Hardware Unboxed said, \"Nvidia have officially decided to ban us from receiving\\nGeForce Founders Edition GPU review samples.

Shortsighted self-own from NVIDIA.\"[247]\\n\\nTwo days later, Nvidia reversed their stance.[248][249] Hardware Unboxed sent out a Twitter message, \"I\\njust received an email from Nvidia apologizing for the previous email & they\\'ve now walked everything\\nback.\"[250][243] On December 14, Hardware Unboxed released a video explaining the controversy from\\ntheir viewpoint.[251] Via Twitter, they also shared a second apology sent by Nvidia\\'s Del Rizzo that said\\n\"to withhold samples because I didn\\'t agree with your commentary is simply inexcusable and crossed the\\nline.\"[252][253]\\n\\nImproper disclosures about cryptomining\\nIn 2018, Nvidia\\'s chips became popular for cryptomining, the process of obtaining crypto rewards in\\nexchange for verifying transactions on distributed ledgers, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\\n(SEC) said. However, the company failed to disclose that it was a \"significant element\" of its revenue\\ngrowth from sales of chips designed for gaming, the SEC further added in a statement and charging order.\\nThose omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of\\ncryptomining on Nvidia\\'s business, the SEC emphasized. Nvidia, which did not admit or deny the\\nfindings, has agreed to pay $5.5 million to settle civil charges, according to a statement made by the SEC\\nin May 2022.[254]\\n\\nFrench Competition Authority Investigation\\nOn September 26, 2023, Nvidia\\'s French offices were searched by the French Competition Authority. The\\nraid, authorized by a judge, was part of an investigation into suspected anti-competitive practices in the\\ngraphics card sector. Nvidia has not publicly commented on the incident.[255]\\n\\nAI regulation dispute with Anthropic\\nIn July 2025, a public dispute emerged between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Anthropic CEO Dario\\nAmodei over AI regulation and industry practices. The conflict escalated when Amodei vehemently\\ndenied Huang\\'s allegations that he sought to control the AI industry through safety concerns, calling\\nHuang\\'s claims an \"outrageous lie.\"[256] The dispute centered on differing philosophies regarding AI\\n\\n\\n\\ndevelopment, with Amodei advocating for stronger regulatory oversight and \"responsible scaling\\npolicies,\" while Huang promoted open-source development and criticized what Nvidia characterized as\\n\"regulatory capture.\"[256] Nvidia responded by stating that \"lobbying for regulatory capture against open\\nsource will only stifle innovation, make AI less safe and secure, and less democratic.\"[256] The\\ncontroversy highlighted broader tensions within the AI industry between companies favoring rapid\\ndevelopment and those emphasizing safety measures and regulation.[256]\\n\\nProposed Shanghai facility\\nIn May 2025, U.S. senators Jim Banks and Elizabeth Warren criticized a proposed Nvidia facility in\\nShanghai, saying that it \"raises significant national security and economic security issues that warrant\\nserious review.\"[257]\\n\\nH20 production halt (2025)\\nIn August 2025, Nvidia ordered suppliers to halt production of its H20 AI chip following Chinese\\ngovernment directives warning domestic companies against purchasing the processor due to security\\nconcerns.[258][259] The company directed suppliers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\\nCompany, Samsung Electronics, and Amkor Technology to suspend work on the China-focused\\nprocessor.[260]\\n\\nThe H20 was developed in late 2023 specifically for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export\\nrestrictions, featuring 96GB of HBM3 memory and 4.0 TB/s memory bandwidth—higher than the H100\\n—but with significantly reduced computational power at 296 TFLOPs compared to the H100\\'s 1979\\nTFLOPs.[261][262] Despite lower raw performance, the H20 demonstrated over 20% faster performance\\nthan the H100 in large language model inference tasks due to architectural optimizations.[261][262]\\n\\nPrior to the production halt, Nvidia had placed substantial orders for the H20, including 300,000 units\\nfrom TSMC in July 2025, driven by strong demand from Chinese technology companies.[263] CEO\\nJensen Huang denied allegations that the H20 contained security backdoors, stating the chips were\\ndesigned solely for commercial use.[264] The production suspension occurred as Nvidia was developing\\nthe B30A, a new chip based on its Blackwell architecture intended to succeed the H20 in the Chinese\\nmarket.[265]\\n\\nSee also\\nSan Francisco Bay\\nArea portal\\nCompanies portal\\n\\nElectronics portal\\n\\nTechnology portal\\n\\nFast approximate anti-aliasing\\nGeneral-purpose computing on graphics processing units\\nHuang\\'s law\\n\\n\\n\\nMolecular modeling on GPUs\\nNvidia Parabricks - GPU-accelerated genomics toolkit\\nGPU workstations\\nGroq\\n\\nNotes\\n\\na.

In September that year, all Tesla cars started\\nshipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called \"hardware version 1\".[40]\\n\\nTesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business) battery\\npacks in April 2015.[41] The company received orders valued at $800\\xa0million within a week of the unveiling.[42]\\n\\nTesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at\\nthe time.[43][44]\\n\\nSolarCity and Model 3 (2016–2018)\\nTesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6\\xa0billion\\ndeal.[45] The business was merged with Tesla\\'s existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy\\nsubsidiary.[46] The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of\\nwhich Tesla\\'s shareholders were not informed.[47] In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better\\nreflect the scope of its expanded business.[48]\\n\\nTesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. The Model 3 was less expensive than Tesla\\'s\\nprevious three vehicles, and within a week, the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[49] To speed up\\nproduction and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3, but the robotics\\nactually slowed the production of the vehicles.[50] This led to significant delays and production problems, a period which\\nthe company described as \"production hell\".[51][52] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and\\nthe Model 3 became the world\\'s best-selling electric car from 2018 to 2021.[53][54]\\n\\nThis period of \"production hell\" put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most\\nshorted companies in the stock market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he\\nwas considering taking Tesla private.[55][56] The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many\\nlawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC, which would force Musk to pay a $20 million fine and step\\ndown as the company\\'s chairman, although he was allowed to remain the CEO.\\n\\nGlobal expansion and Model Y (2019–present)\\nFrom July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible\\nfor inclusion in the S&P 500.[57] During 2020, its share price increased 740%,[58] and by December 14, 2020, its market\\ncapitalization was more than the next nine largest automakers combined,[59] and it became the sixth most valuable\\n\\n\\n\\ncompany in the US.[60] Tesla was added to the S&P index on December 21, 2020;[61] it was the most valuable company\\never added, and was the sixth-largest member of the index immediately after it was added.[61][62]\\n\\nTesla introduced its second mass-market vehicle in March 2019, the Model Y mid-size crossover SUV, based on the Model\\n3.[63][64] Deliveries started in March 2020.[65]\\n\\nDuring this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick\\nsuccession. Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully\\nowned by a foreign company (not a joint venture).[66] The factory\\'s first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out in\\nDecember, less than one year after groundbreaking.[67] Gigafactory Berlin broke ground in February 2020,[68] and its\\nproduction of the Model Y began in March 2022.[69] Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June 2020,[70] and its production\\nof the Model Y began in April 2022.[71] In March 2023, Tesla announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in\\n2025,[72] but its groundbreaking has been delayed.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla closed the Fremont Factory in March 2020 due to California state and\\nAlameda county COVID restrictions.[73] When California lifted restrictions, but the county did not, Tesla sued the county,\\nand restarted production on May 11, 2020.[74] The county lifted restrictions on May 13, 2020, and Tesla dropped its\\nlawsuit.[75] After the dispute with county officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory\\nTexas.[76][77] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years\\nsignificantly expanded its footprint in California. The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in\\nLathrop, California in 2022,[78] and announced in February 2023 that it would establish a large global engineering\\nheadquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard.[79]\\n\\nIn early 2021, Tesla became a major investor in bitcoin, acquiring $1.5\\xa0billion of the cryptocurrency,[80] and on March 24,\\n2021, the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases.[81] However, after 49 days,\\nthe company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of\\nfossil fuels, against the company\\'s mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy.[82] After the announcement,\\nthe price of bitcoin dropped around 12%.[83] Tesla CEO Elon Musk later noted that Tesla would resume bitcoin payments\\nif there was confirmation of at least 50% clean energy usage by bitcoin miners. Despite later reaching this milestone, Tesla\\ndid not return to accepting bitcoin.[84] By July 2022 Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that\\nthe cryptocurrency was hurting the company\\'s profitability.[85]\\n\\nBetween May 2023 and February 2024, almost all major North America EV manufacturers announced plans to switch to\\nTesla\\'s North American Charging Standard adapters on their EVs by 2025, which is expected to be a stable source of\\nrecurring revenue for Tesla.[86] In November, Tesla started shipping the Cybertruck, produced from Gigafactory Texas.[87]\\n\\nIn April 2024, the company announced it was laying off 10% of its employees.[88] In June, the company moved its\\nincorporation from Delaware to Texas.[89] In October, the company unveiled a concept version of two autonomous\\nvehicles – the Cybercab and Robovan – and detailed that both would be an integral part of a Tesla ridehailing service\\ncalled the Tesla Network,[90][91] a future service they had previously teased in 2019.[92]\\n\\nIn December 2024, a Delaware court rejected Elon Musk\\'s $56 billion pay package from Tesla, ruling that it was not\\nproperly approved by the company\\'s board. The decision arose from a lawsuit by Tesla shareholders who claimed the\\ncompensation was excessive and not aligned with performance metrics.[93]\\n\\nBy February 2025, Tesla saw large decreases in its stock price and sales across Europe widely attributed to Elon Musk\\'s\\npolitical advocacy and embrace of far-right politics.[94] Polling found that Musk\\'s ties to United States President Donald\\nTrump and his Department of Government Efficiency were strongly correlated to decreasing views of Tesla,[95][96] and\\ntriggered multiple protests, vandalism, gunfire, and arson at Tesla stores and charging stations.[97][98] By March 7, Tesla\\'s\\nstock had decreased every week for seven straight weeks since Musk joined the Trump administration, making it the\\nlongest losing streak for Tesla in 15 years as a public company.[99] On March 29, over 200 protests against Tesla were held\\nworldwide.[100]\\n\\nIn July 2025, Tesla released a software update adding the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Grok to its vehicles. While the\\nupdate provides in-car chatbot functionality, it does not give Grok control over vehicle functions.[101] The same month,\\nTesla opened its first showroom in India at the Bandra-Kurla Complex in Mumbai, showcasing the Model Y as its debut\\n\\n\\n\\noffering.[102][103]\\n\\nAutomotive products and services\\nAs of November\\xa02024, Tesla offers six vehicle models: Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y, Semi, and Cybertruck.\\nTesla\\'s first vehicle, the first-generation Tesla Roadster, is no longer sold.

Unlike the\\nSupercharger network, Tesla does not own the destination chargers, instead,\\n\\n\\n\\nproperty owners set up the devices and set pricing.[131] When the network first launched\\nin 2014, Tesla provided free charging equipment and covered installation costs. One of\\nthe largest providers is hotel chain Hilton Worldwide which in 2023 announced an\\nagreement with Tesla to install 20,000 chargers across 2,000 of its properties in North\\nAmerica by 2025.[132]\\n\\nInsurance services\\nTesla has offered its own vehicle insurance in the United States since 2017 and has been\\nacting as an independent insurance producer since 2021 as Tesla Insurance Services, Inc.\\nIt was introduced after the American Automobile Association (AAA), a major insurance\\ncarrier, raised rates for Tesla owners in June 2017 after a report concluded that the\\nautomakers vehicles crashed more often and were pricier to repair than comparable\\nvehicles.[133] A study in 2018 based on data from the Insurance Institute for Highway\\nSafety confirmed the findings.[134]\\n\\n\"Destination Charger\" in North\\nAmerica\\n\\nThe company says that it uniquely understands its vehicles, technology and repair costs,\\nand can eliminate traditional insurance carriers\\' additional charges.[135] In states where\\nallowed, the company uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing that can increase or decrease in cost based\\non the prior month\\'s driving safety score.[136]\\n\\nAs of January\\xa0 2023, Tesla offers insurance in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland,\\nMinnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia.[137] The company also offers insurance for non-Tesla\\nvehicles owned by Tesla owners.[135]\\n\\nEnergy products\\nTesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy\\ngeneration systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and\\nservices) to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was\\ncreated by the merger of Tesla\\'s existing battery energy storage products division with\\nSolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016.[138] In 2023, the\\ncompany deployed 14.7 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, an increase\\nof 125% over 2022, but only deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 223\\nmegawatts, a decrease of 36% over 2022.[139]\\n\\nTesla Energy products include solar panels (built by other companies for Tesla), the\\nTesla Solar Roof (a solar shingle system) and the Tesla Solar Inverter. Storage products Two Tesla Powerwall 2 home\\ninclude the Powerwall (a home energy storage device) and the Megapack (a large-scale energy storage devices from\\nenergy storage system).[140][141][142] Tesla Energy\\n\\nFor large-scale customers, Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for\\nautomated, real-time power trading, demand forecasting and product control.[143][144][145] In March 2021, the company\\nsaid its online products were managing over 1.2\\xa0GWh of storage.[146] For home customers, the company operates a virtual\\npower company in Texas called Tesla Electric, which utilizes the company\\'s online platforms to manage customers\\nPowerwall devices, discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high, earning money for\\ncustomers.[147][148]\\n\\nBusiness strategy\\nAt the time of Tesla\\'s founding in 2003, electric vehicles were costly.[149] In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla\\'s strategy\\nwas to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price.\\nThis would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper\\n\\n\\n\\nand higher volume cars.[17][150] Tesla\\'s first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-\\nvolume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The\\nnext models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury\\nvehicles. The Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a\\nhigher volume market,[151][152] selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter.\\nTesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a\\nnew model year, unlike nearly every other car manufacturer.[153]\\n\\nUnlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell\\nvehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a Robotic manufacturing of the Model S at\\nnetwork of company-owned stores.[154][155] The company is the first the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California\\n\\nautomaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers.[156][157]\\n\\nSome jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto\\nmanufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the\\ncompany says, \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of\\nvehicles.\"[158][159] In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries.[160] These locations\\nare typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas,[155] instead of near other\\nauto dealerships.[161][162][163]\\n\\nAnalysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in-house, such as batteries,\\nmotors, and software.[164] The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically\\noutsource 80% of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.[165][166][167]\\n\\nTesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the\\nworld\\'s use of sustainable energy.[168] Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file\\npatent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[169] Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as\\ntrademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.[170]\\n\\nOn April 15, 2024, Tesla secured a deal with Tata Electronics to supply semiconductor chips, marking a significant step in\\nTesla\\'s expansion into India\\'s automotive market.[171]\\n\\nOn May 2, 2024, Tesla announced that it has abandoned its plan for next-generation gigacasting, a cutting-edge\\nmanufacturing technique. Initially aiming to revolutionize production and reduce costs, Tesla has now opted for its more\\nproven method of casting vehicle underbodies in three pieces. This strategic shift reflects the company\\'s focus on self-\\ndriving vehicles and adjusting to market challenges.[172]\\n\\nTechnology\\nTesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[164]\\n\\nBatteries\\nAs of 2023, Tesla uses four different battery cell form factors: 18650, 2170,\\n4680, and prismatic.[173][174][175]\\n\\nTesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers, CATL, LG Energy\\nSolution, and Panasonic, the latter of which has co-located some of its battery\\nproduction inside Tesla\\'s Gigafactory Nevada. Tesla is also currently building\\nout the capacity to produce its own batteries.\\n\\nTesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space. Tesla uses a\\nmultipart aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from\\nroad debris or vehicle crashes.[176] Tesla vehicle chassis used in Model S\\n\\nand X, with the battery visible\\n\\n\\n\\nBusiness analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla\\'s battery pack cost\\nin 2021 at $112 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), versus an industry average of $132\\nper kWh.[177]\\n\\n18650\\nTesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical, lithium-ion battery cells. When\\nit built the first generation Roadster, it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18\\xa0mm\\ndiameter, 65\\xa0mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other\\nconsumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because Comparison of Tesla\\'s three cylindrical\\neach has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together battery cell form factors\\nin a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a\\nchallenge, requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention\\nchemical.[178] However, the decision turned out to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process\\nthat could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest\\ntechnology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum\\n(NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic\\'s factories in Japan.[173]\\n\\n2170\\nThe next battery type to be used was the 2170-type (21\\xa0mm diameter, 70\\xa0mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was\\noptimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170\\nwas introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles.[173]\\n\\nFor vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum\\ncathode chemistry from Panasonic\\'s production line at Gigafactory Nevada.[179] In January 2021, Panasonic had the\\ncapacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there.[180] Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home\\nenergy storage product.\\n\\nFor vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin batteries with a nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC)\\ncathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution\\'s factories in China.[173]\\n\\n4680\\nTesla\\'s latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680-type (46\\xa0mm diameter, 80\\xa0mm height) introduced in 2021. The battery was\\ndeveloped in-house by Tesla and is physically 5-times bigger than the 2170-type, again allowing for a higher capacity per\\ncell and a lower number of cells per battery pack.[181][182] Currently, Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed\\nthe cathode chemistry. The company has already opened production lines in Fremont, California, and plans to open lines\\ninside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas. The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at\\nGigafactory Texas.[173]\\n\\nPrismatic\\nTesla also uses prismatic (rectangular) cells in many entry-level Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.[173] The prismatic cells are\\na lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP or LiFePO4) which is a less energy-dense type, but do not contain any nickel or\\ncobalt, which makes it less expensive to produce.[183] Tesla sources these batteries from CATL\\'s factories in China. As of\\nApril 2022, nearly half of Tesla\\'s vehicle production used prismatic cells.[184] Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its\\nMegapack grid-scale energy storage product.[185]\\n\\nResearch\\nTesla invests in lithium-ion battery research. In 2016, the company established a 5-year battery research and development\\npartnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, with lead researcher Jeff Dahn.[186] Tesla acquired Maxwell\\nTechnologies for over $200 million[187] – and sold in 2021.[188] It also acquired Hibar Systems.[189][190] Tesla purchased\\nseveral battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International, a small Canadian battery\\ncompany.[191][192]\\n\\n\\n\\nLithium Refinement\\nIn 2023 Tesla broke ground on a $375 million lithium refining facility near Robstown, Texas in the US.[193] The plant\\'s\\nprocess will eliminate the use of sulfuric acid in lithium processing, thereby eliminating the associated sodium sulfate\\nwaste product.[193] Local concerns have been raised over the plant\\'s water usage with initial estimates of 400,000\\xa0US\\xa0gal\\n(1,500,000\\xa0 L; 330,000\\xa0 imp\\xa0 gal) per day for normal operation rising to a peak usage estimate of 8,000,000\\xa0 US\\xa0 gal\\n(30,000,000\\xa0L; 6,700,000\\xa0imp\\xa0gal) per day.[194]\\n\\nSoftware\\nTesla uses over-the-air updates to deliver updates to vehicles, adding features or fixing problems.[195] This is enabled by\\ntight integration between a few powerful onboard computers, compared to the way automakers had previously handled\\ntechnology, by purchasing off-the-shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the\\nsoftware level.[196]\\n\\nThe system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to. For example, for ease of assembly\\nall Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats, but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn\\nthem on. However, Tesla has allowed customers who didn\\'t pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear\\nseats.[197] Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full-Self Driving features, even though all\\nvehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features.[198]\\n\\nMotors\\nTesla makes two kinds of electric motors: an induction motor, and an internal permanent magnet (IPM) motor with\\nsynchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) characteristics.\\n\\nThe older design is a three-phase four-pole alternating current induction motor (also called an asynchronous motor) with a\\ncopper rotor (which inspired the Tesla logo).[199] These motors use electromagnetic induction, by varying magnetic field to\\nproduce torque. Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model\\n3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster.\\n\\nSince the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017, Tesla has also been building IPM-SynRM motors. These motors use an iron\\nrotor, with slots cut into the metal where magnets are inserted in the internal core. As an IPM motor, it produces excellent\\nstarting torque; however, performance declines at high speeds due to counter-electromotive forces. For high-speed\\noperation, Tesla engineers used iron\\'s reluctance property, which allows it to spin in synchronization with the magnetic\\nfield of the stator if channels are cut into the core. These channels were also an ideal internal location for the permanent\\nmagnets to be mounted.[200][201] The IPM-SynRM motor is currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y,\\nthe front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi.[202]\\n\\nNorth American Charging Standard\\nThe North American Charging Standard (NACS) is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla. It\\nhas been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since 2012 and was opened for use to other manufacturers in\\n2022. Since then, nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from 2025, their electric vehicles\\nsold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port. Several electric vehicles charging network operators\\nand equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors.[203]\\n\\n\"Autopilot\" and \"Full Self-Driving (Supervised)\"\\nTesla Autopilot is an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) developed by Tesla, Inc. that provides partial vehicle\\nautomation, corresponding to Level 2 automation as defined by SAE International. All Tesla vehicles produced after April\\n2019 include Autopilot,[204] which features autosteer and traffic-aware cruise control. Customers can purchase or subscribe\\nto an optional package called \"Full Self-Driving (Supervised)\", also known as \"FSD\", which adds features such as semi-\\nautonomous navigation, response to traffic lights and stop signs, lane change assistance, self-parking, and the ability to\\nsummon the car from a parking space.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 2013, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly predicted that the company\\nwould achieve fully autonomous driving (SAE Level 5) within one to three\\nyears,[205][206] but these goals have not been met. The branding of Full Self-\\nDriving has drawn criticism for potentially misleading consumers. Tesla\\nvehicles currently operate at Level 2 automation, which requires continuous\\ndriver supervision and does not constitute \"full\" self-driving capability.\\nPreviously, the Autopilot branding was also criticized for similar reasons,\\ndespite the fact that no current autopilot system in aircraft renders them fully\\nautonomous.[207]\\n\\nTesla claims that its driver-assistance features improve safety and reduce Tesla Autopilot in operation, 2017\\n\\naccidents caused by driver fatigue or inattention.[208][209] However, collisions\\nand fatalities involving Autopilot have attracted scrutiny from media and\\nregulators. Industry experts and safety advocates have raised concerns about the deployment of beta software to the general\\npublic, calling the practice risky and potentially irresponsible.[210][211][212][213][214]\\n\\nGlass\\nIn November 2016, the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the\\nTesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof\\'s solar shingles.[215]\\n\\nRobotics\\nIn preparation for Model 3 production, Tesla heavily invested in robotics and automation for vehicle assembly, and\\nbetween 2015 and 2017, the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including\\nCompass Automation,[216] Grohmann Automation,[217] Perbix Machine Company, and Riviera Tool and Die.[218] Musk\\nlater said that the robotics slowed production of the vehicles.[50]\\n\\nSubsequently, Tesla shifted towards using massive casting machines, known as Giga Presses. These machines streamline\\nproduction by creating large, single-piece underbodies, leading to reductions in production time, labor costs, factory\\nfootprint, and the number of welding robots.[219][220] Critics note that reducing the number of components makes the\\nvehicles harder or more expensive to repair after an accident.[221]\\n\\nThe company has been developing a humanoid robot called Optimus since 2022. Musk has stated that Optimus leverages\\nthe same core software powering Tesla\\'s Full Self-Driving technology and has suggested that it could be used within\\nTesla\\'s factories to mitigate labor shortages through the automation of repetitive tasks.[222]\\n\\nFacilities\\nThe company operates seven large factories and about a dozen smaller factories around the world. As of December\\xa02024,\\nthe company also operates more than 1,350 retail stores, galleries, service, delivery and body shop locations globally.[223]\\n\\n\\n\\nPrimary facilities operated by Tesla\\n\\nOpened Name City Country Employees Products Ref.\\n\\n2010 Tesla Fremont [31][224][225]\\nFactory Fremont, California United\\n\\nStates 22,000 Model\\xa0S, Model\\xa0X, Model\\xa03,\\nModel\\xa0Y\\n\\n2016 Gigafactory Storey County, United\\nNevada Nevada States 7,000 Batteries, Powerwall, Semi [226][227][228]\\n\\n2017 Gigafactory New\\nYork Buffalo, New York United\\n\\nStates 1,500 Solar\\xa0Roof, Supercharger [229][230]\\n\\n2019 Gigafactory\\nShanghai Shanghai China 20,000 Model\\xa03, Model\\xa0Y, [231][232]\\n\\nSupercharger\\n\\n2022 Gigafactory Berlin Grünheide Germany 10,000 Model\\xa0Y [233][234][235]\\n\\n2022 Gigafactory Texas Austin, Texas United\\nStates 12,000 Model\\xa0Y, Cybertruck [236][237][238]\\n\\nNorth America\\nTesla was founded in San Carlos, California, in 2003.[239] In 2008, the\\ncompany opened its first production facility at a former Chevrolet dealership in\\nMenlo Park, California. The original roadster was assembled inside the service\\nbays until 2012 and used the company showroom as a retail store.[240] Another\\nretail store was opened in Los Angeles the same year.[241] In 2010, Tesla\\nmoved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development\\nfacility in Palo Alto.[242]\\n\\nTesla\\'s first major assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in\\nFremont, California, known as the Tesla Fremont Factory. The factory was\\noriginally opened by General Motors in 1962, and then operated by NUMMI, a New Tesla Model S cars at the Tesla\\njoint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984.[243] The joint venture ended when Fremont Factory in 2012\\nGM entered bankruptcy in 2009. In 2010, Toyota agreed to sell the plant to\\nTesla at a significant discount.[31]\\n\\nTesla\\'s first purpose-built facility was opened in Nevada in 2016. Gigafactory\\nNevada produces the Powerwall,[226] battery cells in partnership with\\nPanasonic,[244] Model 3 drivetrains,[245] and the Tesla Semi.[246] The factory\\nreceived substantial subsidies (abatements and credits) from the local and state\\ngovernment, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla\\nto operate essentially tax-free for 10 years,[247] later extended to 20 years in\\nexchange for expanding the factory to add a production line for the Tesla Semi\\nand add additional battery manufacturing capacity.[246]\\n\\nGigafactory Nevada in 2019\\nAs part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla gained control of\\nGigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant.\\nThe state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the Buffalo Billion program.[248][249] In 2017, the\\nfactory started production of the Tesla Solar Roof,[229] but faced multiple production challenges. Since 2020, Tesla has\\nalso assembled Superchargers in New York. The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state\\nfunding.[250]\\n\\nIn 2018, Tesla assembled tension fabric buildings at the Fremont plant to meet production goals of 5,000 cars produced a\\nmonth. The structure was assembled in two weeks and measured 53 feet high, 150 feet wide, and 900 feet long.[251]\\n\\nOn July 23, 2020, Tesla picked Austin, Texas, as the site of its fifth Gigafactory, since then known as Gigafactory\\nTexas.[252] Giga Texas is the only factory that produces the Tesla Cybertruck and produces Model Y cars for the Eastern\\nUnited States. On December 1, 2021, Tesla announced it relocated its legal headquarters from Palo Alto to the Gigafactory\\nTexas site in Austin.[253] However, Tesla has retained the Palo Alto building. On April 7, 2022, Tesla celebrated the\\nopening of Gigafactory Texas in a public event.[71]\\n\\n\\n\\nTesla acquired a former JC Penney distribution center near Lathrop, California,\\nin 2021 to build the \"Megafactory\" to manufacture the Megapack, the\\ncompany\\'s large-scale energy storage product.[254][255] The location opened in\\n2022.\\n\\nTesla announced in February it would open a new global engineering\\nheadquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by\\nHewlett Packard, located a couple of miles from Tesla\\'s former headquarters\\n\\nGigafactory Texas in 2022\\nbuilding.[256]\\n\\nTesla has announced plans to open a Gigafactory Mexico, the company\\'s sixth Gigafactory, near Monterrey, Mexico.\\nHowever, as of July\\xa02024, the company had placed construction on hold until after the 2024 United States presidential\\nelection because former President Trump has pledged to add tariffs on cars made in Mexico.[257]\\n\\nEurope\\nTesla opened its first European store in June 2009 in London.[258] Tesla\\'s\\nEuropean headquarters are in the Netherlands,[259] part of a group of Tesla\\nfacilities in Tilburg, including the company\\'s European Distribution\\nCentre.[260]\\n\\nIn late 2016, Tesla acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering\\nas a new division dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and\\neffectiveness of its manufacturing process.[261] After winding down existing\\ncontracts with other manufacturers, the renamed Tesla Automation now works\\nexclusively on Tesla projects.[262]\\n\\nGigafactory Berlin in July\\xa02023\\n\\nTesla announced its plans to build a car and battery factory in Europe in\\n2016.[263] Several countries campaigned to be the host,[264] and eventually Germany was chosen in November 2019.[265]\\n\\nOn March 22, 2022, Tesla\\'s first European Gigafactory named Gigafactory Berlin[266][267] opened with planned capacity to\\nproduce 500,000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars.[267]\\n\\nAsia\\nTesla opened its first showroom in Asia in Tokyo, Japan, in October 2010.[269]\\n\\nIn July 2018, Tesla signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a\\nfactory in Shanghai, China, which was Tesla\\'s first Gigafactory outside the\\nUnited States.[270] The factory building was finished in August 2019, and the\\ninitial Tesla Model 3s were in production from Gigafactory Shanghai in\\nOctober 2019.[231] In 2024, China accounted for 21% of Tesla sales revenue,\\nand was the second-largest market for Tesla after the United States, which\\naccounted for 48% of its sales.[271] Tesla also sold 37% of its cars in China in\\n2024.[272]\\n\\nTesla store in Tokyo, the first in Asia[268]\\n\\nTesla expressed interest in 2023 in expanding to India and perhaps building a\\nfuture Gigafactory in the country.[273] The company established a legal presence in the nation in 2021 and plans to open an\\noffice in Pune starting in October 2023.[274]\\n\\n\\n\\nPartners\\n\\nPanasonic\\nIn January 2010, Tesla and battery cell maker Panasonic announced that they\\nwould together develop nickel-based lithium-ion battery cells for electric\\nvehicles.[275] Beginning in 2010, Panasonic invested $30\\xa0million for a multi-\\nyear collaboration on new battery cells designed specifically for electric\\nvehicles.[276] In July 2014, Panasonic reached a basic agreement with Tesla to\\nparticipate in battery production at Giga Nevada.[277] Tesla and Panasonic also\\ncollaborated on the manufacturing and production of photovoltaic (PV) cells\\nand modules at the Giga New York factory in Buffalo, New York.[229] The\\npartnership started in mid-2017 and ended in early 2020, before Panasonic\\nexited the solar business entirely in January 2021.[278][279]\\n\\nPanasonic Energy president Naoto\\nNoguchi presents Tesla executive J.

In 2014, Tesla ended up adding a titanium plate to\\nprotect the Model S sedan\\'s battery after some debris-related crashes led to cars catching fire.[306][176] On June 5, 2017,\\nToyota announced that it had sold all of its shares in Tesla and halted the partnership.[307][308]\\n\\nMobileye\\nInitial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with Mobileye beginning in 2014.[309] Mobileye ended the\\npartnership on July 26, 2016, citing \"disagreements about how the technology was deployed\".[310]\\n\\nLawsuits and controversies\\n\\nFailed lawsuit alleging unfair review\\nIn 2008 Tesla provided two Roadsters to British entertainment car-testing television programme Top Gear for testing,\\napparently confusing it with another programme, and suggesting \"Matt and Alex could even take the Tesla for a spin and\\ntest it out, reaffirming its virtues?\" Top Gear tested the car as a performance sports car—in a format designed for humour\\nand entertainment, not an unbiased review about its intended purpose—and made some criticisms of its use as such,\\nthough full of praise for its performance and handling on the track. Tesla were so incensed about what it considered unfair\\ncriticism (for example, the test affirmed that in the performance tests they ran the battery charge would have lasted for 55\\nmiles, a figure that actually came from Tesla. Tesla said that the figure was untrue and libellous as the car\\'s mileage in\\nnormal use was claimed to be 211) that they sued, and lost.[311][312]\\n\\nIn 2025, when Tesla was the subject of protests and vandalism in response to Elon Musk\\'s political activities with the\\nTrump government, former Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson published gloating remarks, saying that the vandalism\\nwas \"not funny. But also, it\\'s kinda hilarious. Especially if you\\'re me.\"[313]\\n\\nSexual harassment\\nIn 2021, seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at\\nTesla\\'s Fremont factory.[314] They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment. The women\\nsaid they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, unwanted touching, and discrimination while at\\nwork. \"I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just\\nso I could get some relief,\" Brooks told The Washington Post. \"That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my\\njob.\" Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex.[315]\\n\\nWomen feared calling Human Resources for help, as their supervisors were often participants.[316] Musk himself is not\\nindicted, but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk.\\nThey cite his crude remarks about women\\'s bodies, wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to \"T.IT.S\", and\\nhis generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment.[317] \"What we\\'re addressing for each of the lawsuits\\n\\n\\n\\nis just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla,\" said attorney David A. Lowe.[316] In 2017, another\\nwoman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired. In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla\\nconfirmed the company had terminated her employment, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee\\'s allegations\\nwith the help of \"a neutral, third-party expert\" and concluded her complaints were unmerited.[318]\\n\\nIn May 2022, a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court, rejecting Tesla\\'s request for\\nclosed-door arbitration.[319]\\n\\nLabor disputes\\nTesla has had labor disputes in the United States, Germany and Sweden,\\nincluding an ongoing strike in Sweden. Tesla, Inc., an American electric car\\nand solar panel manufacturer, has more than 140,000 workers employed across\\nits global operations as of January 2024.[320] Tesla CEO Elon Musk has\\nexpressed his opposition to unions on Twitter (now called X). The National\\nLabor Relations Board held that one tweet was unlawful, but was overturned\\nby a federal appeals court.[321] All unionization efforts at the Tesla Fremont\\nFactory and Gigafactory New York in the United States have been\\nunsuccessful.[322] In Germany, Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Tesla\\nAutomation have elected works councils, but they have not signed collective\\nbargaining agreements with the German trade union IG Metall.[323][324] The\\nGigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg works council is divided into pro-union and\\nanti-union factions.[325] In Sweden, mechanics who are members of the trade\\nunion IF Metall have been on strike since October 27, 2023, making it the\\nlongest strike in Sweden since 1938.[326] The strike has since spread, with\\nother Swedish, Danish and Norwegian unions calling for solidarity strikes.[327]\\n\\nAccidents, repairs and safety violations\\nValentine\\'s Day union drive at Giga New\\n\\nIn June 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) York in 2023\\ntook issue with Tesla\\'s use of nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) regarding\\ncustomer repairs[328] and, in October 2021, the NHTSA formally asked Tesla\\nto explain its NDA policy regarding customers invited into the FSD Beta.[329] Tesla has used NDAs on multiple occasions\\nwith both employees[330] and customers[331] to allegedly prevent possible negative coverage.[332][333]\\n\\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Tesla\\'s Fremont Factory had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration\\n(OSHA) violations as the ten largest U.S. auto plants combined.[334] An investigation by the Reveal podcast alleged that\\nTesla \"failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports\" to downplay the extent of injuries.[335]\\n\\nIn January 2019, former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company\\nhad hacked employees\\' phones and spied on them, while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and\\nshareholders.[336][337][338] Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla. These\\ninclude the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez[339][340] and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen.[341] In\\n2020, the court ordered Hansen\\'s case to arbitration.[342] In June 2022, the arbitrator filed an unopposed motion with the\\ncourt stating Hansen \"has failed to establish the claims… Accordingly, his claims are denied, and he shall take\\nnothing\".[343]\\n\\nThe California Civil Rights Department filed a suit in 2022 alleging \"a pattern of racial harassment and bias\" at the Tesla\\nFremont factory. As of April 2023, the department is also conducting a probe of the factory based on a 2021 complaint and\\nclaims that Tesla has been obstructing the investigation.[344]\\n\\nAccording to Jalopnik, a 2024 study by iSeeCars found that Tesla had the highest fatal crash rate of any automaker in the\\nUnited States.[345]\\n\\nA 2025 lawsuit in California alleged that Tesla odometers were falsely exaggerating their readings to prematurely void\\ntheir warranty.[346]\\n\\n\\n\\nFraud allegations\\nThere have been numerous concerns about Tesla\\'s financial reporting. In 2013, Bloomberg News questioned whether\\nTesla\\'s financial reporting violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) reporting standards.[347] Fortune\\naccused Tesla in 2016 of using creative accounting to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits.[348] In 2018, analysts\\nexpressed concerns over Tesla\\'s accounts receivable balance.[349] In September 2019, the SEC questioned Tesla CFO Zach\\nKirkhorn about Tesla\\'s warranty reserves and lease accounting.[350] In a letter to his clients, hedge fund manager David\\nEinhorn, whose firm suffered losses from its short position against Tesla that quarter, accused Elon Musk in November\\n2019 of \"significant fraud\",[351][352] and publicly questioned Tesla\\'s accounting practices, telling Musk that he was\\n\"beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist.\"[353]\\n\\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than $295\\xa0 million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a battery-swapping\\ntechnology that was never made available to customers.[354] Staff at California Air Resources Board were concerned that\\nTesla was \"gaming\" the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits.[355]\\n\\nA consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition, that he and\\nthe Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection\\nwith the deal, and failed to disclose \"troubling facts\" essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition.[356] The members\\nof the board settled in 2020, leaving Musk as the only defendant.[357] In April 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled\\nin favor of Musk,[358][359] and its ruling was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in June 2023.[360]\\n\\nIn August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\"[361] The tweet\\ncaused the stock to initially rise, but then drop when it was revealed to be false.[362][363][364] Musk settled fraud charges\\nwith the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his false statements in September 2018. According to the\\nterms of the settlement, Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla\\'s in-house counsel, he was removed from his\\nchairman role at Tesla temporarily, and two new independent directors were appointed to the company\\'s board.[365] Tesla\\nand Musk also paid civil penalties of $20\\xa0million each.[365] A civil class-action shareholder lawsuit over Musk\\'s statements\\nand other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Tesla\\'s board of directors, as then\\nconstituted, regarding claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private.[366][367] In February\\n2023, a California jury unanimously found Musk and Tesla not liable in the class-action lawsuit.[368]\\n\\nIn September 2018, Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\\nregarding its Model 3 production figures.[369] Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and\\nmade projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet.[369] A stockholder class action\\nlawsuit against Tesla related to Model 3 production numbers (unrelated to the FBI investigation) was dismissed in March\\n2019.[370][371][372]\\n\\nIn May 2024, Reuters reported that US federal prosecutors were investigating whether the company committed securities\\nor wire fraud by \"misleading investors and consumers\" about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.[373]\\n\\nTesla US dealership disputes\\nUnlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles and instead directly sells\\nvehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. In some areas, Tesla operates locations called\\n\"galleries\" which \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale\\nof vehicles.\"[158] This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from\\ndirectly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These\\nassociations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete, lowering the price a\\ncustomer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their dealers.[161] The United\\nStates Federal Trade Commission ultimately disproved the associations\\' claims and recommended allowing direct\\nmanufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[374][375][376]\\n\\nTesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars.[377] The company has argued that directly\\noperating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles,[158] because dealerships would sell both Tesla and\\ngas-powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since\\nproperly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas-powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to\\n\\n\\n\\ndealership EV sales.[161] Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles\\nbecause they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after-sales service revenue, a large profit center for most\\ndealerships.[129]\\n\\nIntellectual property\\nTesla has sued former employees for stealing company information, including those who left to work for a rival such as\\nXPeng and Zoox.[378] For example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading Tesla Autopilot source code\\nto his iCloud account,[379] and Alex Khatilov was accused of downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his\\npersonal Dropbox account.[380]\\n\\nMisappropriation\\nIn 2018, a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla\\'s board alleging they breached their fiduciary\\nduties by approving Musk\\'s stock-based compensation plan.[367] Musk received the first portion of his stock options\\npayout, worth more than $700\\xa0million in May 2020.[381]\\n\\nIn July 2023, Tesla board members returned $735 million to the company to settle a claim from a 2020 lawsuit alleging\\nmisappropriation of 11 million stock options granted to Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Larry Ellison, and others from 2017 to\\n2020.[382]\\n\\nEnvironmental violations\\nIn 2019, The United States Environmental Protection Agency fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in\\n2017.[383] In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the Bay Area Air Quality\\nManagement District;[384] the violations took place around Tesla Fremont\\'s paint shop, where there had been at least four\\nfires between 2014 and 2019.[385] Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla\\'s Fremont Factory increased\\nfrom 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3.[386]\\n\\nIn June 2018, Tesla employee Martin Tripp leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40% of its raw\\nmaterials at the Nevada Gigafactory.[387] After Tesla fired him for the leak, Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Tesla\\'s\\nsecurity team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory.[388][336] The court ruled in\\nTesla\\'s favor on September 17, 2020.[389][390]\\n\\nIn January 2024, 25 California counties sued Tesla, accusing the company of violating state health and safety codes by\\nillegally disposing of hazardous waste. Later that week, the case was settled on the conditions that Tesla pay US$1.5\\nmillion and admit to acting \"intentionally\" and \"negligent\". Moreover, Tesla also agreed to train its employees on\\nhazardous waste disposal and to have 10 percent of Tesla\\'s facilities audited for waste disposal for the next 5\\nyears.[391][392][393]\\n\\nProperty damage\\nIn August 2019, Walmart filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that Tesla\\'s \"negligent installation and\\nmaintenance\" of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012.[394] Walmart reached a\\nsettlement with Tesla in November 2019; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[395]\\n\\nIn April 2021, a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 over-the-air software\\nupdate, after they failed to respond to the lawsuit. The 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit were awarded 136,000\\nNorwegian kroner each ($16,000).[396][397]\\n\\nRacism\\nTesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination,[398][399] with one former\\nTesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as \"a hotbed of racist behavior.\"[400] As of December 2021,\\nthree percent of leadership at the company were African-American.[401] A former Black worker described the work\\n\\n\\n\\nenvironment at Tesla\\'s Buffalo plant as a \"very racist place.\"[402] Tesla and SpaceX\\'s treatment of Juneteenth in 2020 also\\ncame under fire.[403] Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that the company\\ndiscriminates specifically against African Americans and \"allows a racist environment in its factories.\"[404]\\n\\nFew of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements.[405]\\n\\nEmployees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court, and behind closed doors.\\n\\nFremont, California, plant\\nAccording to the state\\'s Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place\\nwhere Black employees claim they are given the most menial[398] and physically demanding work.[406] The accusations of\\nracism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for\\n\"discriminating against its Black workers.\"[407]\\n\\nIn July 2021, former employee Melvin Berry received $1\\xa0 million in his discrimination case in arbitration against the\\ncompany after he claimed he was referred to by the n-word and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant.[408]\\n\\nIn October 2021, a jury verdict in the Owen Diaz vs. Tesla trial awarded the plaintiff $137\\xa0million in damages after he had\\nfaced racial harassment at Tesla\\'s Fremont facility during 2015–2016.[409][410] In a blog, Tesla stressed that Diaz was never\\n\"really\" a Tesla worker, and that most uttering of the n-word were expressed in a friendly manner.[411][412] In April 2022,\\nfederal judge William Orrick upheld the jury finding of Tesla\\'s liability but reduced the total damage down to\\n$15\\xa0 million.[413] Diaz was given a two-week deadline to decide if he would collect the damages. In June 2022, Diaz\\nannounced that he would be rejecting the $15\\xa0million award, opening the door for a new trial.[414] In April 2023, Diaz was\\nawarded $3.2 million in the new trial.[415]\\n\\nCOVID-19 pandemic\\nTesla\\'s initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been the subject of considerable criticism.\\nMusk had sought to exempt the Tesla Fremont factory in Alameda County, California from the government\\'s stay-at-home\\norders. In an earnings call in April, he was heard calling the public health orders \"fascist\".[416] He had also called the\\npublic\\'s response to the pandemic \"dumb\" and had said online that there would be zero cases by April.[417] In May 2020,\\nwhile Alameda County officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont Factory on the 18th, Musk\\ndefied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th.[418][419][420] Tesla also sued Alameda County,\\nquestioning the legality of the orders, but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen.[421][422] In\\nJune 2020, Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe,[423] however some\\nemployees still expressed concern for their health.[424]\\n\\nIn May 2020, Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work.[425] But in\\nJune, Tesla dismissed an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers\\nfrom the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory.[426] Three more employees at Tesla\\'s Fremont Factory claimed they were laid\\noff for staying home out of fear of catching COVID-19. This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the\\nemployees were still on the payroll.[427] COVID-19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December\\n2020, with about 450 total cases in that time out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant (4.5%).[416][428]\\n\\nIn China, Tesla had what one executive described as \"not a green light from the government to get back to work\\xa0– but a\\nflashing-sirens police escort.\"[429] Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China, including tax\\nbreaks, cheap financing, and assistance in building its Giga Shanghai factory at breakneck speeds.[429] Musk has praised\\nChina\\'s way of doing things, a controversial stance due to deteriorating U.S.–Chinese relations, the Persecution of Uyghurs\\nin China, and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong.[429]\\n\\nRight to repair\\nIn March 2023, a class action antitrust lawsuit was filed against Tesla by Virginia M.

The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between\\n2014 and 2021. Around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera, and around 14% of recalled\\nmodel S\\' may have the defect. The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the \"Passenger Play\"\\nfeature, which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion.[472] After an investigation was\\nlaunched by the NHTSA covering 585,000 vehicles, Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and\\nunusable while the car is moving.[473]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn September 2022, Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 1.1\\xa0million US model vehicles because the automatic\\nwindow reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury.[474][475] In\\nresponse,} Tesla announced an over-the-air software fix.[475]\\n\\nIn February 2023, Tesla recalled its FSD software following a recommendation from NHTSA; the recall applied to\\napproximately 360,000 cars.[476] NHTSA found that FSD caused \"unreasonable risk\" when used on city streets.[477] In\\nMarch 2023, about 3,500 Model Y Teslas were recalled for a bolting issue concerning the cars\\' second-row seats.[478]\\n\\nIn December 2023, following a 2-year investigation by the NHTSA,[479] Tesla issued a wider recall on all vehicles\\nequipped with any version of Autosteer, including 2012–2023 Model S; 2016–2023 Model X; 2017–2023 Model 3; and\\n2020–2023 Model Y, covering 2,031,220 vehicles in total.[480] The NHTSA concluded that Autosteer\\'s controls were not\\nsufficient to prevent misuse and did not ensure that the drivers maintained \"continuous and sustained responsibility for\\nvehicle operation\" and states that affected vehicles will receive an over-the-air software remedy.[480][481]\\n\\nFires\\nTesla customers have reported the company as being \"slow\" to address how their cars can ignite.[482] In 2013, a Model S\\ncaught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the\\nbattery pack and was caused by the impact of an object.[483] As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its\\ndecision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[484] In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had\\nclosed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection\\nto its battery packs.[485] All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25-inch (6.4\\xa0mm) aluminum\\nshield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[486] In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an\\ninvestigation into possible battery defects in Tesla\\'s Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause \"non-\\ncrash\" fires.[487][488][489]\\n\\nAutopilot crashes\\nA Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is\\nbelieved to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot.[490][491] The NHTSA investigated the accident\\nbut found no safety-related defect trend.[492] In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash.\\nInvestigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in \\'self-driving\\' mode and was using his phone to play games\\nwhen the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the\\nTesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.[493]\\n\\nAccording to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that\\nwere believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities.[494][495] In early September 2021, the\\nNHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident[496] and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data\\npertaining to US cars with Autopilot to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-\\nresponder vehicles.[496][497][498] In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect\\nemergency lights at night.[499] In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it did not issue a recall when it sent out that\\nupdate.[500] In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla\\nmodels. The probe was moved up from the Preliminary Evaluation level to Engineering Analysis. The regulator cited the\\nreason for the expansion as the need to \"explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may\\nexacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver\\'s supervision.\"[501]\\n\\nA safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full\\nSelf-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[502] but there has been controversy over its\\nconclusions.[503] Several Tesla owners responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA\\nreleased a statement warning against the practice.[504]\\n\\nIn 2025, the California DMV filed a lawsuit against Tesla, claiming they had misled drivers about its vehicles\\' self-driving\\ncapabilities. The DMV sought to suspend Tesla\\'s sales and manufacturing in the state of California for a minimum of 30\\ndays.[505][506]\\n\\n\\n\\nSoftware hacking\\nIn August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car\\'s\\nentertainment system.[507] The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[508] Tesla issued a security\\nupdate for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.[509]\\n\\nIn September 2016, researchers at Tencent\\'s Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and\\ncontrolled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the\\nautomotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle\\'s web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a\\nmalicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[510] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability\\nwas disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made\\npublic.[511] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[512]\\n\\nIn January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed\\ndirectly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing\\nthe compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the\\ncompromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[513][514] Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car\\nand $375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event.[515]\\n\\nIn June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier\\nto start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their keys to a\\nvehicle.[516]\\n\\nPhantom braking\\nIn February 2022, Tesla drivers have reported a surge in \"phantom braking\" events when using Tesla Autopilot which\\ncoincides with the automaker\\'s removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021.[517] In response, NHTSA opened\\nan investigation the same month.[518] In August 2022, a consumer class action was filed alleging that the Autopilot system\\nin Tesla cars \"contains a hazardous defect which causes the vehicle to suddenly and unintentionally brake\".[519][520] In\\nNovember 2024, Tesla failed to persuade a U.S. District Judge to dismiss the lawsuit.[521] The next court date is January 7,\\n2025.[521]\\n\\nIn May 2023, German business newspaper Handelsblatt published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla\\ndata submitted to them from informants.[522] The 100 gigabytes of data \"contain[ed] over 1,000 accident reports involving\\nphantom braking or unintended acceleration\" as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot.[523] Dutch authorities responded\\nby saying they were investigating the company for possible data privacy violations.[524]\\n\\nIn February 2025, a German court declared Tesla Autopilot as defective for normal use due to phantom braking issues.[525]\\n\\nIn February 2025, a group of Australian buyers sued Tesla with a class action over multiple issues like battery range,\\ndriving assistance and phantom braking.[526]\\n\\nDriving range performance\\nTesla has received thousands of complaints from owners that the driving ranges of their vehicles did not meet the ranges\\nadvertised by Tesla or the projections of in-dash range meters. When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments\\nto take care of these issues, Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible. Customers were\\ntold that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem and their appointments were canceled. The company has\\nbeen fined by South Korean regulators for its exaggerated range estimates.[527]\\n\\nVehicle sales\\nIn 2024, Tesla ranked as the world\\'s best-selling battery electric passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of\\n17.6%.[528] Tesla reported 2023 vehicle deliveries of 1.8 million units, up 38% from 2022.[529][530] In March 2024, Tesla\\nproduced its six millionth car.[531] In Q4 2023, BYD took over the top spot for EVs shipped, but Tesla regained the title in\\n\\n\\n\\nQ1 2024.[532]\\n\\nTesla sells the most vehicles in the US (674,000+ in 2023) and has received $11.4 billion in regulatory credits from federal\\nand state governments. The federal government previously provided a $7500 rebate to customers.[533][534][535] Tesla\\nreceived around $426 million from the Chinese government for cars manufactured at its Shanghai facility.[536] Germany\\nwas Tesla\\'s third largest market in 2023, selling 63,682 units. Germany ended its EV subsidy program in December 2023.\\nUnder the program, a €6,750 discount was provided with Tesla paying €2,250. Tesla announced it would cover the entire\\ndiscount going forward.[537] In 2023, over 63,000 Teslas were sold in France with customers receiving up to €7,000 via the\\nbonus écologique. The government decreased the budget for EV aid from €1.5 billion to €700 million in 2024.[538] Canada\\nwas in Tesla\\'s top five markets in 2023 with over 52,000 vehicles sold. In 2025, Tesla was accused of having \"a run on the\\nbank\" when it sold an historic 8,600 vehicles in 72 hours before Canada\\'s EV rebate program\\'s funds were depleted. Tesla\\nclaimed 4000 vehicles alone were sold over one weekend in Quebec City.[539][540] The Government of Canada announced\\non March 25, 2025, that it had suspended the rebates and was investigating. The government also declared Tesla would be\\nineligible for any future rebates as long as the US tariffs on Canadian products continued.[541] Elon Musk has stated he is\\nagainst government subsidies but will take them if they are available.[542]\\n\\nSales have been negatively impacted by Elon Musk\\'s actions during the second Trump presidency.[543][544] Tesla sales\\nhave decreased worldwide (the most in countries like France, Germany, the UK, Sweden, Norway, and the\\nNetherlands)[545][546] with his vocal support for far-right parties such as Reform UK[547] and AfD[548] in Germany along\\nwith his Nazi salute controversy leading to boycotts of his products and Tesla vehicles being nicknamed Swasticars.[554]\\n\\nGerman sales fell 76% in February 2025 compared to February 2024.[555][556]\\n\\nTesla\\'s shares dropped over 9 percent after its sales in the EU and UK declined by nearly half in January 2025, bringing its\\nvaluation below $1 trillion for the first time since November 2024. While European electric car sales surged, Tesla\\nstruggled against rising competition, particularly from Chinese automakers.[557] In May 2025, it was reported that the\\ncompany\\'s sales in Europe declined every month since the start of the year, including in April where sales dropped 49\\npercent to 7,261 from 14,228 in April 2024.[558] As of May 2025, the company has a 0.7 percent market share in Europe,\\ndown from 1.3 percent a year ago.[558]\\n\\nProduction and sales by quarter\\n\\n600,000\\n\\n500,000\\n\\n400,000\\n\\n300,000\\n\\n200,000\\n\\n100,000\\n\\n3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2\\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\\n\\n\\xa0  Model S \\xa0  Model S/X \\xa0  Model 3\\n\\xa0  Model X \\xa0  Models Other Than 3/Y \\xa0  Model 3/Y\\n\\nTesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as availability of car carriers and registration. On\\nMarch 9, 2020, the company produced its 1\\xa0millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a\\nmilestone.[559] In the third quarter of 2021, Tesla sold its 2 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to\\nachieve such a milestone.[560] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y became the world\\'s best-selling car, surpassing the\\nToyota Corolla.[561]\\n\\n\\n\\nFinances\\nFor the fiscal (and calendar) year 2021, Tesla\\nreported a net income of $5.52\\xa0billion.[562] The Tesla financial performance\\n\\nannual revenue was $53.8\\xa0 billion, an increase\\nof 71% over the previous fiscal year.[562]\\n\\nOf the revenue number in 2021, $314\\xa0 million came from Sales by business (2024)[563]\\n\\nselling regulatory credits to other automakers to meet\\nBusiness Sales in billion $ Share\\n\\ngovernment pollution standards.

In an April 2017 public letter, a group of\\ninfluential Tesla investors, including the California State Teachers\\' Retirement System, asked Tesla to add two new\\nindependent directors to its board \"who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk\".[575] The investors wrote that\\n\"five of six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their\\nability to exercise independent judgement.\"[576] Tesla\\'s directors at the time included Brad Buss, who served as chief\\nfinancial officer at SolarCity; Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who also sits on the board of SpaceX;[577] Elon Musk\\'s\\nbrother, Kimbal; and Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias, both of whom also invested in SpaceX.[578] The letter called for\\n\\n\\n\\na more independent board that could put a check on groupthink.[576] At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the\\ninvestors \"should buy Ford stock\" because \"their governance is amazing.\"[576] Two days later, he promised he would add\\ntwo independent board members;[579] Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Larry Ellison were added at the end of 2018.[580]\\n\\nEllison stepped down in August 2022.[581] Former Tesla CTO J.

IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M\\nOS to be used in the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC).[19] For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M\\nclone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products which it branded as MS-DOS, although IBM\\nrebranded it to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS following the release of the\\nIBM PC in August 1981. IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, so other companies had to reverse\\nengineer it for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the\\noperating systems. Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor.[20][21]:\\u200a210\\u200a The\\ncompany expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as with a\\npublishing division named Microsoft Press.[10]:\\u200a232\\u200a Paul Allen resigned from Microsoft in 1983 after\\ndeveloping Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma.[22] Allen claimed in Idea Man: A Memoir by the co-founder of\\nMicrosoft that Gates wanted to dilute his share in the company when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin\\'s\\ndisease because he did not think that he was working hard enough.[23] Allen later invested in low-tech\\nsectors, sports teams, commercial real estate, neuroscience, private space flight, and more.[24]\\n\\n\\n\\n1985–1994: Windows and Office\\nMicrosoft released Windows 1.0 on November 20, 1985, as a\\ngraphical extension for MS-DOS,[10]:\\u200a242–243,\\u200a246\\u200a despite\\nhaving begun jointly developing OS/2 with IBM that\\nAugust.[25] Microsoft moved its headquarters from Bellevue\\nto Redmond, Washington, on February 26, 1986, and went\\npublic with an initial public offering (IPO) at the NASDAQ\\nexchange on March 13,[26] with the resulting rise in stock\\nmaking an estimated four billionaires and 12,000\\xa0millionaires\\nfrom Microsoft employees.[27] Microsoft released its version\\nof OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on Windows 1.0 was released on November\\nApril 2, 1987.[10] In 1990, the Federal Trade Commission 20, 1985, as the first version of the\\nexamined Microsoft for possible collusion due to the Windows line.\\npartnership with IBM, marking the beginning of more than a\\ndecade of legal clashes with the government.[28] :\\u200a243–244\\u200a\\n\\nMeanwhile, the company was at work on Microsoft Windows NT, which was heavily based on their copy\\nof the OS/2 code. It shipped on July 21, 1993, with a new modular kernel and the 32-bit Win32\\napplication programming interface (API), making it easier to port from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based)\\nWindows. Microsoft informed IBM of Windows NT, and the OS/2 partnership deteriorated.[29]\\n\\nIn 1990, Microsoft introduced the Microsoft Office suite which bundled separate applications such as\\nMicrosoft Word and Microsoft Excel.[10]:\\u200a301\\u200a On May 22, Microsoft launched Windows 3.0, featuring\\nstreamlined user interface graphics and improved protected mode capability for the Intel 386\\nprocessor,[30] and both Office and Windows became dominant in their respective areas.[31][32]\\n\\nOn July 27, 1994, the Department of Justice\\'s Antitrust Division filed a competitive impact statement that\\nsaid: \"Beginning in 1988 and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute\\nanti-competitive per processor licenses. Under a per-processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty\\nfor each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer\\nwith a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to\\nMicrosoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM\\'s use of a\\ncompeting PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft\\'s use of per processor licenses has increased.\"[33]\\n\\n1995–2007: Foray into the Web, Windows 95, Windows XP, and Xbox\\nFollowing Bill Gates\\'s internal \"Internet Tidal Wave memo\" on May 26, 1995, Microsoft began to\\nredefine its offerings and expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web.[34]\\n\\nWith a few exceptions of new companies, like Netscape, Microsoft was the only major and established\\ncompany that acted fast enough to be a part of the World Wide Web practically from the start. Other\\ncompanies like Borland, WordPerfect, Novell, IBM and Lotus, being much slower to adapt to the new\\nsituation, would give Microsoft market dominance.[35]\\n\\nThe company released Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, featuring pre-emptive multitasking, a completely\\nnew user interface with a novel start button, and 32-bit compatibility; similar to NT, it provided the\\nWin32 API.[36][37]:\\u200a20\\u200a Windows 95 came bundled with the online service MSN, which was at first\\nintended to be a competitor to the Internet, and (for OEMs) Internet Explorer, a Web browser. Internet\\nExplorer was not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes, because the boxes were printed before the\\n\\n\\n\\nteam finished the Web browser, and instead were included in\\nthe Windows 95 Plus! pack.[38] Backed by a high-profile\\nmarketing campaign[39] and what The New York Times called\\n\"the splashiest, most frenzied, most expensive introduction of\\na computer product in the industry\\'s history,\"[40] Windows 95\\nquickly became a success.[41] Branching out into new markets\\nin 1996, Microsoft and General Electric\\'s NBC unit created a\\nnew 24/7 cable news channel, MSNBC.[42] Microsoft created\\nWindows CE 1.0, a new OS designed for devices with low\\nmemory and other constraints, such as personal digital\\n\\nIn 1996, Microsoft released Windows CE,\\na version of the operating system meant assistants.[43] In October 1997, the Justice Department filed a\\nfor personal digital assistants and other motion in the Federal District Court, stating that Microsoft\\ntiny computers, shown here on the HP violated an agreement signed in 1994 and asked the court to\\n300LX. stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with\\n\\nWindows.[10]:\\u200a323–324\\u200a\\n\\nOn January 13, 2000, Bill Gates handed over the CEO position to\\nSteve Ballmer, an old college friend of Gates and employee of the\\ncompany since 1980, while creating a new position for himself as\\nChief Software Architect.[10]:\\u200a111,\\u200a228\\u200a[14] Various companies including\\nMicrosoft formed the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance in\\nOctober 1999 to (among other things) increase security and protect\\nintellectual property through identifying changes in hardware and\\nsoftware. Critics decried the alliance as a way to enforce While primarily focused on\\nindiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software, and software, Microsoft also\\nover how computers behave, and as a form of digital rights produced a number of\\nmanagement: for example, the scenario where a computer is not only successful PC accessories, such\\n\\nsecured for its owner but also secured against its owner as as the IntelliMouse computer\\n\\nwell.[44][45] On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the mice shown here\\n\\ncase of United States v. Microsoft Corp.,[46] calling the\\ncompany an \"abusive monopoly\".[47] Microsoft later settled\\nwith the U.S. Department of Justice in 2004.[26]\\n\\nOn October 25, 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP,\\nunifying the mainstream and NT lines of OS under the NT\\ncodebase.[48] The company released the Xbox later that year,\\nentering the video game console market dominated by Sony Microsoft released the first installment in\\nand Nintendo.[49] In March 2004 the European Union brought the Xbox series of consoles in 2001. The\\nantitrust legal action against the company, citing it abused its Xbox, graphically powerful compared to\\n\\ndominance with the Windows OS, resulting in a judgment of its rivals, featured a standard PC\\'s\\n733\\xa0MHz Intel Pentium III processor.\\n\\n€497\\xa0 million ($613\\xa0 million) and requiring Microsoft to\\nproduce new versions of Windows XP without Windows\\nMedia Player: Windows XP Home Edition N and Windows XP Professional N.[50][51] In November 2005,\\nthe company\\'s second video game console, the Xbox 360, was released. There were two versions, a basic\\nversion for $299.99 and a deluxe version for $399.99.[52]\\n\\n\\n\\nIncreasingly present in the hardware business following Xbox, Microsoft 2006 released the Zune series of\\ndigital media players, a successor of its previous software platform Portable Media Center. These\\nexpanded on previous hardware commitments from Microsoft following its original Microsoft Mouse in\\n1983; as of 2007 the company sold the best-selling wired keyboard (Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000),\\nmouse (IntelliMouse), and desktop webcam (LifeCam) in the United States.

As of July 2010, with the company\\'s nine\\nstock splits, any IPO shares would be multiplied by 288; if one were to buy the IPO today, given the splits\\nand other factors, it would cost about 9\\xa0 cents.[10]:\\u200a235–236\\u200a[204][205] The stock price peaked in 1999 at\\naround $119 ($60.928, adjusting for splits).[206] The company began to offer a dividend on January 16,\\n2003, starting at eight cents per share for the fiscal year followed by a dividend of sixteen cents per share\\nthe subsequent year, switching from yearly to quarterly dividends in 2005 with eight cents a share per\\n\\n\\n\\nquarter and a special one-time payout\\nof three dollars per share for the\\nsecond quarter of the fiscal\\nyear.[206][207] Though the company\\nhad subsequent increases in dividend\\npayouts, the price of Microsoft\\'s stock\\nremained steady for years.[207][208]\\n\\nStandard & Poor\\'s and Moody\\'s\\nInvestors Service have both given a\\nAAA rating to Microsoft, whose Five year history graph of Nasdaq:\\xa0MSFT (https://www.nasdaq.co\\nassets were valued at $41\\xa0 billion as m/market-activity/stocks/msft) stock on July 17, 2013.[203]\\n\\ncompared to only $8.5\\xa0 billion in\\nunsecured debt. Consequently, in\\nFebruary 2011 Microsoft released a corporate bond amounting to $2.25\\xa0 billion with relatively low\\nborrowing rates compared to government bonds.[209] For the first time in 20 years Apple Inc. surpassed\\nMicrosoft in Q1 2011 quarterly profits and revenues due to a slowdown in PC sales and continuing huge\\nlosses in Microsoft\\'s Online Services Division (which contains its search engine Bing). Microsoft profits\\nwere $5.2\\xa0billion, while Apple Inc. profits were $6\\xa0billion, on revenues of $14.5\\xa0billion and $24.7\\xa0billion\\nrespectively.[210] Microsoft\\'s Online Services Division has been continuously loss-making since 2006 and\\nin Q1 2011 it lost $726\\xa0million. This follows a loss of $2.5\\xa0billion for the year 2010.[211]\\n\\nOn July 20, 2012, Microsoft posted its first quarterly loss Sales by region (2023)[212]\\n\\never, despite earning record revenues for the quarter and Region Sales in billion $ share\\nfiscal year, with a net loss of $492\\xa0 million due to a\\nwritedown related to the advertising company aQuantive, United States 106.7 50.4%\\n\\nwhich had been acquired for $6.2\\xa0billion back in 2007.[213] Other countries 105.2 49.6%\\nAs of January 2014, Microsoft\\'s market capitalization stood\\nat $314B,[214] making it the 8th-largest company in the world by market capitalization.[215] On\\nNovember 14, 2014, Microsoft overtook ExxonMobil to become the second most-valuable company by\\nmarket capitalization, behind only Apple Inc. Its total market value was over $410B—with the stock price\\nhitting $50.04 a share, the highest since early 2000.[216] In 2015, Reuters reported that Microsoft Corp\\nhad earnings abroad of $76.4\\xa0billion which were untaxed by the Internal Revenue Service. Under U.S.\\nlaw, corporations do not pay income tax on overseas profits until the profits are brought into the United\\nStates.[217]\\n\\nThe key trends of Microsoft are (as at the financial year ending June 30):[218][219]\\n\\n\\n\\nRevenue Net income Total Assets\\nYear in billion US$[220] in billion US$[220] in billion US$[220] Employees[221]\\n\\n2005 39.7 12.2 70.8 61,000\\n\\n2006 44.2 12.5 69.5 71,000\\n\\n2007 51.1 14.0 63.1 79,000\\n\\n2008 60.4 17.6 72.7 91,000\\n\\n2009 58.4 14.5 77.8 93,000\\n\\n2010 62.4 18.7 86.1 89,000\\n\\n2011 69.9 23.1 108 90,000\\n\\n2012 73.7 16.9 121 94,000\\n\\n2013 77.8 21.8 142 99,000\\n\\n2014 86.8 22.0 172 128,000\\n\\n2015 93.5 12.1 174 118,000\\n\\n2016 91.1 20.5 193 114,000\\n\\n2017 96.5 21.2 250 124,000\\n\\n2018 110 16.5 258 131,000\\n\\n2019 125 39.2 286 144,106\\n\\n2020 143 44.2 301 163,000\\n\\n2021 168 61.2 333 181,000\\n\\n2022 198 72.7 364 221,000\\n\\n2023 211 72.3 411 238,000\\n\\n2024 245 88.1 512 228,000\\n\\n2025 282 101.8 619 228,000\\n\\nIn November 2018, the company won a $480\\xa0million military contract with the U.S. government to bring\\naugmented reality (AR) headset technology into the weapon repertoires of American soldiers. The two-\\nyear contract may result in follow-on orders of more than 100,000 headsets, according to documentation\\ndescribing the bidding process. One of the contract\\'s tag lines for the augmented reality technology seems\\nto be its ability to enable \"25 bloodless battles before the 1st battle\", suggesting that actual combat\\ntraining is going to be an essential aspect of the augmented reality headset capabilities.[222]\\n\\nSubsidiaries\\nMicrosoft is an international business. As such, it needs subsidiaries present in whatever national markets\\nit chooses to harvest. An example is Microsoft Canada, which it established in 1985.[223] Other countries\\nhave similar installations, to funnel profits back up to Redmond and to distribute the dividends to the\\nholders of MSFT stock.\\n\\nOwnership\\nThe 10 largest shareholders of Microsoft in early 2024 were:[212][224]\\n\\n\\n\\nShareholder name Percentage\\n\\nThe Vanguard Group 8.9%\\n\\nBlackRock 5.6%\\n\\nState Street Corporation 4.0%\\n\\nSteve Ballmer 4.0%\\n\\nFidelity Investments 2.9%\\n\\nGeode Capital Management 2.1%\\n\\nT.

After suffering extended downtime and unreliability[228][229] the London\\nStock Exchange announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a\\nLinux-based one in 2010.[230][231]\\n\\nIn 2012, Microsoft hired a political pollster named Mark Penn, whom The New York Times called\\n\"famous for bulldozing\" his political opponents[232] as Executive Vice-president, Advertising and\\nStrategy. Penn created a series of negative advertisements targeting one of Microsoft\\'s chief competitors,\\nGoogle. The advertisements, called \"Scroogled\", attempted to make the case that Google is \"screwing\"\\nconsumers with search results rigged to favor Google\\'s paid advertisers, that Gmail violates the privacy of\\n\\n\\n\\nits users to place ad results related to the content of their emails and shopping results, which favor Google\\nproducts. Tech publications like TechCrunch were highly critical of the advertising campaign,[233] while\\nGoogle employees embraced it.[234]\\n\\nLayoffs\\nIn July 2014, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 18,000 employees. Microsoft employed 127,104\\npeople as of June 5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest\\nMicrosoft layoff ever. This included 12,500 professional and factory personnel. Previously, Microsoft had\\neliminated 5,800 jobs in 2009 in line with the Great Recession of 2008–2017.[235][236] In September\\n2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle–Redmond area, where the\\ncompany is headquartered. The firings came as a second wave of the layoffs that were previously\\nannounced. This brought the total number to over 15,000 out of the 18,000 expected cuts.[237] In October\\n2014, Microsoft revealed that it was almost done with eliminating 18,000 employees, which was its\\nlargest-ever layoff sweep.[238] In July 2015, Microsoft announced another 7,800 job cuts in the next\\nseveral months.[239] In May 2016, Microsoft announced another 1,850 job cuts mostly in its Nokia\\nmobile phone division. As a result, the company will record an impairment and restructuring charge of\\napproximately $950\\xa0million, of which approximately $200\\xa0million will relate to severance payments.[240]\\n\\nMicrosoft laid off 1,900 employees in its gaming division in January 2024. The layoffs primarily affected\\nActivision Blizzard employees, but some Xbox and ZeniMax employees were also affected.[241] Blizzard\\npresident Mike Ybarra and chief design officer Allen Adham also resigned.[242]\\n\\nIn May 2025, Microsoft announced that it is laying off more than 6,000 employees, around three percent\\nof the company\\'s entire workforce.[243] In July 2025, Microsoft announced another round of layoffs,\\ncutting approximately 9,000 employees in its largest workforce reduction in over two years. The cuts\\naffected multiple divisions, including Xbox, with 830 positions eliminated at its Redmond, Washington\\nheadquarters.[244][245] Amid the layoffs, Microsoft also announced that it was quitting Pakistan after 25\\nyears of operations.[246][247] While the exit was part of shift in business strategies and preference for\\ncloud based models, the company\\'s exit from Pakistan was also reportedly attributed to \"growing\\ndifficulties\" with the country\\'s business environment.[248]\\n\\nUnions\\nMicrosoft recognizes seven trade unions[e] representing 1,750 workers in the United States at its video\\ngame subsidiaries Activision Blizzard and ZeniMax Media.[249] U.S. workers have been vocal in\\nopposing military and law-enforcement contracts with Microsoft.[250] Bethesda Game Studios is\\nunionized in Canada.[251] Microsoft South Korea has recognized its union since 2017.[252][253] German\\nemployees have elected works councils since 1998.[254]\\n\\nUnited States government\\nMicrosoft provides information about reported bugs in its software to intelligence agencies of the United\\nStates government, prior to the public release of the fix. A Microsoft spokesperson stated that the\\ncorporation runs several programs that facilitate the sharing of such information with the U.S.\\ngovernment.[255] Following media reports about PRISM, NSA\\'s massive electronic surveillance program,\\n\\n\\n\\nin May 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Microsoft.[256]\\n\\nAccording to leaks of said program, Microsoft joined the PRISM program in 2007.[257] However, in June\\n2013, an official statement from Microsoft flatly denied its participation in the program:\\n\\n\"We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so,\\nand never on a voluntary basis. In addition, we only ever comply with orders for requests about\\nspecific accounts or identifiers. If the government has a broader voluntary national security\\nprogram to gather customer data, we don\\'t participate in it.\"[258]\\n\\nDuring the first six months of 2013, Microsoft received requests that affected between 15,000 and 15,999\\naccounts.[259] In December 2013, the company made a statement to further emphasize that it takes its\\ncustomers\\' privacy and data protection very seriously, saying that \"government snooping potentially now\\nconstitutes an \\'advanced persistent threat,\\' alongside sophisticated malware and cyber attacks\".[260] The\\nstatement also marked the beginning of three-part program to enhance Microsoft\\'s encryption and\\ntransparency efforts. On July 1, 2014, as part of this program, it opened the first (of many) Microsoft\\nTransparency Center, which provides \"participating governments with the ability to review source code\\nfor our key products, assure themselves of their software integrity, and confirm there are no \"back\\ndoors.\"[261] Microsoft has also argued that the United States Congress should enact strong privacy\\nregulations to protect consumer data.[262]\\n\\nIn April 2016, the company sued the U.S. government, argued that secrecy orders were preventing the\\ncompany from disclosing warrants to customers in violation of the company\\'s and customers\\' rights.\\nMicrosoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from\\ninforming its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents and that the\\nFourth Amendment made it so people or businesses had the right to know if the government searches or\\nseizes their property. On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit as a result of a policy\\nchange by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ). The DoJ had \"changed data request rules on\\nalerting the Internet users about agencies accessing their information.\"\\n\\nIn 2022 Microsoft shared a $9 billion contract from the United States Department of Defense for cloud\\ncomputing with Amazon, Google, and Oracle.[263]\\n\\nSecurity challenges\\nOn a Friday afternoon in January 2024, Microsoft disclosed that a Russian state-sponsored group hacked\\ninto its corporate systems. The group, accessed \"a very small percentage\" of Microsoft corporate email\\naccounts, which also included members of its senior leadership team and employees in its cybersecurity\\nand legal teams.[264] Microsoft noted in a blog post that the attack might have been prevented if the\\naccounts in question had enabled multi-factor authentication, a defensive measure which is widely\\nrecommended in the industry, including by Microsoft itself.[265]\\n\\n\\n\\nCorporate identity\\n\\nCorporate culture\\nTechnical references for developers and articles for various Microsoft magazines such as Microsoft\\nSystems Journal (MSJ) are available through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). MSDN also\\noffers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer\\naccess to pre-release beta versions of Microsoft software.[266][267] In April 2004, Microsoft launched a\\ncommunity site for developers and users, titled Channel 9, that provides a wiki and an Internet forum.[268]\\n\\nAnother community site that provides daily videocasts and other services, On10.net, launched on March\\n3, 2006.[269] Free technical support is traditionally provided through online Usenet newsgroups, and\\nCompuServe in the past, monitored by Microsoft employees; there can be several newsgroups for a single\\nproduct. Helpful people can be elected by peers or Microsoft employees for Microsoft Most Valuable\\nProfessional (MVP) status, which entitles them to a sort of special social status and possibilities for\\nawards and other benefits.[270]\\n\\nNoted for its internal lexicon, the expression \"eating your own dog food\" is used to describe the policy of\\nusing pre-release and beta versions of products inside Microsoft to test them in \"real-world\"\\nsituations.[271] This is usually shortened to just \"dog food\" and is used as a noun, verb, and adjective.\\nAnother bit of jargon, FYIFV or FYIV (\"Fuck You, I\\'m [Fully] Vested\"), is used by an employee to\\nindicate they are financially independent and can avoid work anytime they wish.[272]\\n\\nMicrosoft is an outspoken opponent of the cap on H-1B visas, which allows companies in the U.S. to\\nemploy certain foreign workers. Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas makes it difficult to hire\\nemployees for the company, stating \"I\\'d certainly get rid of the H1B cap\" in 2005.[273] Critics of H1B\\nvisas argue that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment for U.S. citizens due to H1B\\nworkers working for lower salaries.[274]\\n\\nThe Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, a report of how progressive the organization\\ndeems company policies towards LGBT employees, rated Microsoft as 87% from 2002 to 2004 and as\\n100% from 2005 to 2010 after it allowed gender expression.[275]\\n\\nIn August 2018, Microsoft implemented a policy for all companies providing subcontractors to require 12\\nweeks of paid parental leave to each employee. This expands on the former requirement from 2015\\nrequiring 15 days of paid vacation and sick leave each year.[276] In 2015, Microsoft established its own\\nparental leave policy to allow 12 weeks off for parental leave with an additional 8 weeks for the parent\\nwho gave birth.[277]\\n\\nEnvironment\\nIn 2011, Greenpeace released a report rating the top ten big brands in cloud computing on the sources of\\nelectricity for their data centers. At the time, data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity, and\\nthis amount was projected to increase. Phil Radford of Greenpeace said, \"We are concerned that this new\\nexplosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy\\n\\n\\n\\navailable today\",[278] and called on \"Amazon, Microsoft and other leaders of the information-technology\\nindustry must embrace clean energy to power their cloud-based data centers\".[279] In 2013, Microsoft\\nagreed to buy power generated by a Texas wind project to power one of its data centers.[280]\\n\\nMicrosoft is ranked on the 17th place in Greenpeace\\'s Guide to Greener Electronics (16th Edition) that\\nranks 18 electronics manufacturers according to its policies on toxic chemicals, recycling, and climate\\nchange.[281] Microsoft\\'s timeline for phasing out brominated flame retardant (BFRs) and phthalates in all\\nproducts was 2012 but its commitment to phasing out PVC is not clear. As of January\\xa02011, it has no\\nproducts that are completely free from PVC and BFRs.[282]\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s main U.S. campus received a silver certification from the Leadership in Energy and\\nEnvironmental Design (LEED) program in 2008, and it installed over 2,000 solar panels on top of its\\nbuildings at its Silicon Valley campus, generating approximately 15 percent of the total energy needed by\\nthe facilities in April 2005.[283] Microsoft makes use of alternative forms of transit. It created one of the\\nworld\\'s largest private bus systems, the \"Connector\", to transport people from outside the company; for\\non-campus transportation, the \"Shuttle Connect\" uses a large fleet of hybrid cars to save fuel. The\\n\"Connector\" does not compete with the public bus system and works with it to provide a cohesive\\ntransportation network not just for its employees but also for the public.[284]\\n\\nMicrosoft also subsidizes regional public transport, provided by Sound Transit and King County Metro,\\nas an incentive.[283][285] In February 2010, however, Microsoft took a stance against adding additional\\npublic transport and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to the State Route 520 and its floating bridge\\nconnecting Redmond to Seattle; the company did not want to delay the construction any further.[286]\\n\\nMicrosoft was ranked number 1 in the list of the World\\'s Best Multinational Workplaces by the Great\\nPlace to Work Institute in 2011.[287]\\n\\nIn January 2020, the company announced a strategy to take the company carbon negative by 2030 and to\\nremove all carbon that it has emitted since its foundation in 1975.[288][289][290] On October 9, 2020,\\nMicrosoft permanently allowed remote work.[291] In January 2021, the company announced on Twitter to\\njoin the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, which engages the cloud infrastructure and data centers\\nindustries to reach carbon neutrality in Europe by 2030, and also disclosed an investment in Climeworks,\\na direct air capture company partnered with Carbfix for carbon sequestration.[list 1] In the same year, it\\nwas awarded the EPA\\'s Green Power Leadership Award, citing the company\\'s all-renewable energy use\\nsince 2014.[297]\\n\\nIn September 2023, Microsoft announced that it purchased $200 million in carbon credits to offset\\n315,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide over 10 years from Heirloom Carbon, a carbon removal company\\nthat mixes calcium oxide from heated crushed limestone with water to form carbon hydroxide to absorb\\ncarbon dioxide from the atmosphere to mineralize back into limestone while the released carbon dioxide\\nis stored underground or injected into concrete.[298][299] Despite spending spent more than $760 million\\nthrough its Climate Innovation Fund by June 2024 on sustainability projects—including purchases of\\nmore than 5 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide removal with carbon offsets and more than 34\\nmegawatts of renewable energy—Microsoft\\'s Scope 3 emissions had increased by 31% from the\\ncompany\\'s 2020 baseline, which caused the company\\'s total emissions to rise by 29% in 2023.[300]\\n\\nIn 2023 Microsoft consumed 24 TWh of electricity, more than countries such as Iceland, Ghana, the\\nDominican Republic, or Tunisia.[301]\\n\\n\\n\\nHeadquarters\\nThe corporate headquarters, informally known as the\\nMicrosoft Redmond campus, is located at One Microsoft Way\\nin Redmond, Washington. Microsoft initially moved onto the\\ngrounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, weeks before\\nthe company went public on March 13. The headquarters has\\nsince experienced multiple expansions since its establishment.\\nIt is estimated to encompass over 8\\xa0million ft2 (750,000\\xa0m2)\\nof office space and 30,000–40,000 employees.[302] Additional\\noffices are located in Bellevue and Issaquah, Washington Building 92, home to the Microsoft Visitor\\n(90,000 employees worldwide). The company is planning to Center\\nupgrade its Mountain View, California, campus on a grand\\nscale. The company has occupied this campus since 1981. In\\n2016, the company bought the 32-acre (13\\xa0ha) campus, with plans to renovate and expand it by 25%.[303]\\n\\nMicrosoft operates an East Coast headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina.[304]\\n\\nIn April 2024, it was announced that Microsoft would be opening a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence\\n\\'hub\\' around Paddington in London, England. It was announced that the division would be led by Jordan\\nHoffman, who previously worked for Deepmind and Inflection.[305]\\n\\nFlagship stores\\nOn October 26, 2015, the company opened its retail location\\non Fifth Avenue in New York City. The location features a\\nfive-story glass storefront and is 22,270 square feet.[306] As\\nper company executives, Microsoft had been on the lookout\\nfor a flagship location since 2009.[307] The company\\'s retail\\nlocations are part of a greater strategy to help build a\\nconnection with its consumers. The opening of the store\\ncoincided with the launch of the Surface Book and Surface\\nPro 4.[308] On November 12, 2015, Microsoft opened a Microsoft\\'s Toronto flagship store\\nsecond flagship store, located in Sydney\\'s Pitt Street\\nMall.[309]\\n\\nLogo\\nMicrosoft adopted the so-called \"Pac-Man Logo\", designed by Scott Baker, on February 26, 1987, with\\nthe concept being similar to InFocus Corporation logo that was adapted a year earlier in 1986. Baker\\nstated \"The new logo, in Helvetica italic typeface, has a slash between the o and s to emphasize the \"soft\"\\npart of the name and convey motion and speed\".[310] Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save\\nthe old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter O, nicknamed the blibbet,\\nbut it was discarded.[311]\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s logo with the tagline \"Your potential. Our passion.\"—below the main corporate name—is\\nbased on a slogan Microsoft used in 2008. In 2002, the company started using the logo in the United\\nStates and eventually started a television campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of\\n\"Where do you want to go today?\"[312][313][314] During the private MGX (Microsoft Global Exchange)\\n\\n\\n\\nconference in 2010, Microsoft unveiled the company\\'s next tagline, \"Be What\\'s Next.\"[315] It also had a\\nslogan/tagline \"Making it all make sense.\"[316] The Microsoft Pac-Man logo was used for 25 years, 5\\nmonths, and 28 days until August 23, 2012, being the longest enduring logo to be used by the company.\\n\\nOn August 23, 2012, Microsoft unveiled a new corporate logo at the opening of its 23rd Microsoft store\\nin Boston, indicating the company\\'s shift of focus from the classic style to the tile-centric modern\\ninterface, which it uses/will use on the Windows Phone platform, Xbox 360, Windows 8 and the\\nupcoming Office Suites.[317] The new logo also includes four squares with the colors of the then-current\\nWindows logo which have been used to represent Microsoft\\'s four major products: Windows (blue),\\nOffice (orange), Xbox (green) and Bing (yellow).[318] The logo also resembles the opening of one of the\\ncommercials for Windows 95.[319][320]\\n\\nMicrosoft logo history\\n \\n\\nca. 1975 – 1980: First Microsoft 1980–June 25, 1982: Second\\nlogo.

The organisation\\'s key areas of focus are: donating\\ncloud computing resources to university researchers and\\nnonprofit groups; supporting the expansion of broadband access worldwide; funding international\\ncomputer science education through YouthSpark; supporting tech education in the U.S. from kindergarten\\nto high school; and donating to global child and refugee relief organizations.[323][324]\\n\\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft\\'s president, Brad Smith, announced that an initial batch of\\nsupplies, including 15,000 protection goggles, infrared thermometers, medical caps, and protective suits,\\nwas donated to Seattle, with further aid to come soon.[325]\\n\\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine Microsoft started monitoring cyberattacks originating from the\\nGovernment of Russia and Russia-backed hackers. In June 2022, Microsoft published the report on\\nRussian cyber attacks and concluded that state-backed Russian hackers \"have engaged in \"strategic\\nespionage\" against governments, think tanks, businesses and aid groups\" in 42 countries supporting\\nKyiv.[326][327]\\n\\nMicrosoft also supports initiatives through its AI for Accessibility grant program, providing funding to\\nvarious global organizations that create technologies to enhance accessibility for individuals with\\ndisabilities. Among grant recipients from the Asia-Pacific region are Sri Lankan IT company Fortude,\\nThailand-based Vulcan Coalition, and Indonesian organization Kerjabilitas.[328]\\n\\nControversies\\nCriticism of Microsoft has followed various aspects of its products and business practices. Frequently\\ncriticized are the ease of use, robustness, and security of the company\\'s software. It has also been\\ncriticized for the use of permatemp employees (employees employed for years as \"temporary\", and\\ntherefore without medical benefits), the use of forced retention tactics, which means that employees\\nwould be sued if they tried to leave.[330] Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking\\nemployees, in many cases, leading to burnout within just a few years of joining the company. The\\ncompany is often referred to as a \"Velvet Sweatshop\", a term which originated in a 1989 Seattle Times\\narticle,[331] and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft\\'s own employees.[332]\\n\\nThis characterization is derived from the perception that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its\\nemployees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their\\n(possibly long-term) health.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs reported by several news outlets,[333][334] an Irish\\nsubsidiary of Microsoft based in the Republic of Ireland\\ndeclared £220 bn in profits but paid no corporation tax for the\\nyear 2020. This is due to the company being tax resident in\\nBermuda as mentioned in the accounts for \\'Microsoft Round\\nIsland One, a subsidiary that collects license fees from the use\\nof Microsoft software worldwide. Dame Margaret Hodge, a\\nLabour MP in the UK said, \"It is unsurprising – yet still\\nshocking – that massively wealthy global corporations\\nopenly, unashamedly and blatantly refuse to pay tax on the\\n\\nPRISM is a clandestine surveillance\\nprofits they make in the countries where they undertake program under which the NSA collects\\nbusiness\".[334]\\n\\nuser data from companies like Microsoft\\nand Facebook.[329]\\n\\nIn 2020, ProPublica reported that the company had diverted\\nmore than $39 billion in U.S. profits to Puerto Rico using a\\nmechanism structured to make it seem as if the company was unprofitable on paper. As a result, the\\ncompany paid a tax rate on those profits of \"nearly 0%\". When the Internal Revenue Service audited\\nthese transactions, ProPublica reported that Microsoft aggressively fought back, including successfully\\nlobbying Congress to change the law to make it harder for the agency to conduct audits of large\\ncorporations.[335][336] In 2023, Microsoft reported in a securities filing that the U.S. Internal Revenue\\nService was alleging that the company owed the U.S. $28.9 billion in past taxes, plus penalties related to\\nmis-allocation of corporate profits over a decade.[337]\\n\\n\"Embrace, extend, and extinguish\" (EEE),[338] also known as \"embrace, extend, and exterminate,\"[339] is\\na phrase that the U.S. Department of Justice found[340] that was used internally by Microsoft[341] to\\ndescribe its strategy for entering product categories involving widely used standards, extending those\\nstandards with proprietary capabilities, and then using those differences to strongly disadvantage\\ncompetitors. Microsoft is frequently accused of using anticompetitive tactics and abusing its monopolistic\\npower. People who use their products and services often end up becoming dependent on them, a process\\nis known as vendor lock-in.\\n\\nMicrosoft was the first company to participate in the PRISM surveillance program, according to leaked\\nNSA documents obtained by The Guardian[342] and The Washington Post[343] in June 2013, and\\nacknowledged by government officials following the leak.[344] The program authorizes the government to\\nsecretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Microsoft has\\ndenied participation in such a program.[345]\\n\\nJesse Jackson believes Microsoft should hire more minorities and women. In 2015, he praised Microsoft\\nfor appointing two women to its board of directors.[346]\\n\\nIn 2020, Salesforce, the manufacturer of the Slack platform, complained to European regulators about\\nMicrosoft due to the integration of the Teams service into Office 365. Negotiations with the European\\nCommission continued until the summer of 2023, but, as it became known to the media, they reached an\\nimpasse. Microsoft is now facing an antitrust investigation.[347]\\n\\nIn June 2024, Microsoft Corp. faced a potential EU fine after regulators accused it of abusing market\\npower by bundling its Teams video-conferencing app with its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software. The\\nEuropean Commission issued a statement of objections, alleging Microsoft\\'s practice since 2019 gave\\n\\n\\n\\nTeams an unfair market advantage and limited interoperability with competing software. Despite\\nMicrosoft\\'s efforts to avoid deeper scrutiny, including unbundling Teams, regulators remained\\nunconvinced. This action followed a 2019 complaint from Slack, which was later acquired by Salesforce.\\nMicrosoft\\'s Teams usage soared during the pandemic, growing from 2 million daily users in 2017 to 300\\nmillion in 2023. The company has a history of antitrust battles in the U.S. and Europe, with over €2\\nbillion in EU fines previously imposed for similar abuses.[348]\\n\\nIn October 2024, Microsoft fired two employees, software engineers Ibtihal Aboussad and Vaniya\\nAgrawal,[349] who organized an unauthorized vigil at its Redmond headquarters to honor Palestinians\\nkilled in the Gaza war. The employees, part of the group \"No Azure for Apartheid\", sought to address the\\ncompany\\'s involvement in the Israeli government\\'s use of its technology.[350] On March 20, 2025, before\\nan event at Seattle\\'s Great Hall with Brad Smith and Steve Ballmer, protestors projected \"Microsoft\\npowers genocide\" on the wall. Subsequently, two employees interrupted AI executive Mustafa Suleyman\\nat a speaking event on April 4, 2025, in protest at the company\\'s support of Israel.[351] The Boycott,\\nDivestment and Sanctions movement added Microsoft to its list of targets for partnering \"with the\\napartheid regime of Israel and its prison system\".[352] In February 2025, the Associated Press reported\\nthat the Israeli military was utilizing Microsoft-developed artificial intelligence tools in its military and\\nintelligence operations against the people of Gaza. In May 2025, Microsoft issued an unsigned statement\\nconfirming that these services had been made available to Israel, while denying that these tools were\\nemployed during the massacre of the people of Gaza.[353] In August 2025 it was reported that Microsoft\\nprovides storage for mass-surveilled Palestinian phone calls that have been used to identify bombing\\ntargets in Gaza.[354]\\n\\nIn November 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation into Microsoft,\\nfocusing on potential antitrust violations related to its cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity businesses.\\nThe probe scrutinized Microsoft\\'s bundling of cloud services with products like Office and security tools,\\nas well as its growing AI presence through its partnership with OpenAI. This inquiry is part of broader\\nefforts by the U.S. government to curb the power of major tech companies, especially under FTC chair\\nLina Khan. Concerns were raised about Microsoft\\'s licensing practices potentially locking customers into\\nits services and its AI investments possibly sidestepping regulatory oversight.[355]\\n\\nIn June 2025 Microsoft helped suspend the email account of an International Criminal Court (ICC)\\nprosecutor in the Netherlands who was investigating Israel for war crimes in order to comply with a\\nTrump executive order.[356][357] In June 2025, a UN expert\\'s report named Microsoft as being \"central to\\nIsrael\\'s surveillance apparatus and the ongoing Gaza destruction.\"[358]\\n\\nSee also\\nList of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft\\nMicrosoft engineering groups\\nMicrosoft Enterprise Agreement\\n\\nNotes\\na.

Rajeev Motwani\\nand Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and\\nBrin the first paper about the project, describing\\nPageRank and the initial prototype of the Google\\nsearch engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-\\nMolina and Jeffrey Ullman were also cited as\\ncontributors to the project.[36] PageRank was\\ninfluenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring Google\\'s original homepage had a simplistic\\nalgorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by design because the company founders had little\\n\\nRobin Li in 1996, with Larry Page\\'s PageRank patent experience in HTML, the markup language used\\nfor designing web pages[30]\\n\\nincluding a citation to Li\\'s earlier RankDex patent; Li\\nlater went on to create the Chinese search engine\\nBaidu.[37][38]\\n\\nEventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the\\nword googol,[23][39][40] a very large number written 10100 (1 followed by 100 zeros), picked to signify\\nthat the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[41]\\n\\nGoogle was initially funded by an August 1998 investment of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim,[23] co-\\nfounder of Sun Microsystems. This initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company\\nto be able to use the funds.[42][43] Page and Brin initially approached David Cheriton for advice because\\nhe had a nearby office in Stanford, and they knew he had startup experience, having recently sold the\\ncompany he co-founded, Granite Systems, to Cisco for $220 million. David arranged a meeting with Page\\nand Brin and his Granite co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The meeting was set for 8 a.m. at the front\\nporch of David\\'s home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another meeting at Cisco,\\nwhere he now worked after the acquisition, at 9 a.m. Andy briefly tested a demo of the website, liked\\nwhat he saw, and then went back to his car to grab the check. David Cheriton later also joined in with a\\n$250,000 investment.[44][45]\\n\\nGoogle received money from two other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and\\nentrepreneur Ram Shriram.[46] Page and Brin had first approached Shriram, who was a venture capitalist,\\nfor funding and counsel, and Shriram invested $250,000 in Google in February 1998. Shriram knew\\n\\n\\n\\nBezos because Amazon had acquired Junglee, at which Shriram was the president. It was Shriram who\\ntold Bezos about Google. Bezos asked Shriram to meet Google\\'s founders and they met six months after\\nShriram had made his investment when Bezos and his wife were on a vacation trip to the Bay Area.\\nGoogle\\'s initial funding round had already formally closed but Bezos\\' status as CEO of Amazon was\\nenough to persuade Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment.[47][48]\\n\\nBetween these initial investors, friends and family Google raised around $1,000,000, which is what\\nallowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California.[49] Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD\\nstudent at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.[25][50][51]\\n\\nAfter some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[46] a new $25 million\\nround of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[52] with major investors including the venture capital\\nfirms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital.[43] Both firms were initially hesitant about investing jointly in\\nGoogle, as each wanted to retain a larger percentage of control over the company to themselves. Larry\\nand Sergey however insisted on taking investments from both. Both venture companies finally agreed to\\ninvesting jointly $12.5 million each due to their belief in Google\\'s great potential and through the\\nmediation of earlier angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram who had contacts in the venture\\ncompanies.[53]\\n\\nGrowth\\nIn March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California,[54] which is home to several\\nprominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.[55] The next year, Google began selling advertisements\\nassociated with search keywords against Page and Brin\\'s initial opposition toward an advertising-funded\\nsearch engine.[56][25] To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.[57]\\n\\nIn June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!,\\none of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.[58][59]\\n\\nIn 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an\\noffice complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway\\nin Mountain View, California.[61] The complex became known as the\\nGoogleplex, a play on the word googolplex, the number one followed\\nby a googol of zeroes. Three years later, Google bought the property\\nfrom SGI for $319\\xa0 million.[62] By that time, the name \"Google\" had\\nfound its way into everyday language, causing the verb \"google\" to be\\nadded to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford\\nEnglish Dictionary, denoted as: \"to use the Google search engine to\\nobtain information on the Internet\".[63][64] The first use of the verb on\\ntelevision appeared in an October 2002 episode of Buffy the Vampire\\nSlayer.[65]\\n\\nAdditionally, in 2001 Google\\'s investors felt the need to have a strong\\ninternal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the\\nchairman and CEO of Google.[49] Eric was proposed by John Doerr\\nfrom Kleiner Perkins. He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey Google\\'s first production\\n\\nserver[60]\\nand Larry would accept for several months, but they rejected several\\ncandidates because they wanted to retain control over the company.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichael Moritz from Sequoia Capital at one point even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay\\nback Sequoia\\'s $12.5m investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer,\\nwhich had been made verbally during investment negotiations. Eric was not initially enthusiastic about\\njoining Google either, as the company\\'s full potential had not yet been widely recognized at the time, and\\nas he was occupied with his responsibilities at Novell where he was CEO. As part of him joining, Eric\\nagreed to buy $1 million of Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment and to provide\\nfunds Google needed.[66]\\n\\nInitial public offering\\nOn August 19, 2004, Google became a public company via an initial public offering. At that time Page,\\nBrin and Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024.[67] The company\\nopened on the NASDAQ National Market under the ticker symbol GOOGL with an offering of\\n19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[68][69] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a\\nsystem built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.[70][71] The sale of $1.67\\nbillion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[72]\\n\\nOn October 9, 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in\\nGoogle stock,[73][74][75][76] On July 20, 2007, Google bids $4.6 billion\\nfor the wireless-spectrum auction by the FCC.[77] On March 11, 2008,\\nGoogle acquired DoubleClick for $3.1\\xa0 billion, transferring to Google\\nvaluable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and\\nadvertising agencies.[78][79] By 2011, Google was handling\\napproximately 3 billion searches per day. To handle this workload,\\nGoogle built 11 data centers around the world with several thousand\\nservers in each. These data centers allowed Google to handle the ever-\\nchanging workload more efficiently.[49]\\n\\nIn May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google\\nsurpassed one billion for the first time.[80][81] In May 2012, Google\\nacquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5\\xa0billion, in its largest acquisition Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google\\n\\nto date.[82][83][84] This purchase was made in part to help Google gain from 2001 to 2011\\n\\nMotorola\\'s considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless\\ntechnologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[85] mainly\\nApple and Microsoft,[86] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android.[87]\\n\\n2012 onwards\\nIn June 2013, Google acquired Waze for $966 million.[88] While Waze would remain an independent\\nentity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable\\nintegrations between Waze and Google Maps, Google\\'s own mapping service.[89] Google announced the\\nlaunch of a new company, called Calico, on September 19, 2013, to be led by Apple Inc. chairman Arthur\\nLevinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the \"health and well-being\" company\\nwould focus on \"the challenge of ageing and associated diseases\".[90]\\n\\n\\n\\nOn January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquire\\nDeepMind Technologies, a privately held AI company from\\nLondon.[91] Technology news website Recode reported that the\\ncompany was purchased for $400 million, yet the source of the\\ninformation was not disclosed. A Google spokesperson declined to\\ncomment on the price.[92][93] The purchase of DeepMind aids in\\nGoogle\\'s recent growth in the AI and robotics community.[94] In 2015,\\nDeepMind\\'s AlphaGo became the first computer program to defeat a\\ntop human pro at the game of Go.\\n\\nAccording to Interbrand\\'s annual Best Global Brands report, Google\\nhas been the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple\\nInc.) in 2013,[95] 2014,[96] 2015,[97] and 2016, with a valuation of $133\\nbillion.[98] Entrance of building where\\n\\nGoogle and its subsidiary Deep\\n\\nOn August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various Mind are located at 6 Pancras\\n\\ninterests as a conglomerate named Alphabet Inc. Google became Square, London\\n\\nAlphabet\\'s largest subsidiary and the umbrella company for Alphabet\\'s\\nInternet interests. Upon completion of the restructuring, Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google, replacing\\nLarry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.[99][100][101]\\n\\nOn August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore\\nafter he distributed a memo throughout the company that\\nargued bias and \"Google\\'s Ideological Echo Chamber\"\\nclouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that\\nit is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that\\ncause the average woman to be less interested than men in\\ntechnical positions.[102] Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused\\nDamore of violating company policy by \"advancing harmful\\ngender stereotypes in our workplace\", and he was fired on the\\nsame day.[103][104][105] Current CEO, Sundar Pichai, with Prime\\n\\nMinister of India, Narendra Modi\\n\\nBetween 2018 and 2019, tensions between the company\\'s\\nleadership and its workers escalated as staff protested\\ncompany decisions on internal sexual harassment, Dragonfly, a censored Chinese search engine, and\\nProject Maven, a military drone artificial intelligence, which had been seen as areas of revenue growth\\nfor the company.[106][107] On October 25, 2018, The New York Times published the exposé, \"How Google\\nProtected Andy Rubin, the \\'Father of Android\\'\". The company subsequently announced that \"48\\nemployees have been fired over the last two years\" for sexual misconduct.[108] On November 1, 2018,\\nmore than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walk-out to protest the company\\'s\\nhandling of sexual harassment complaints.[109][110] CEO Sundar Pichai was reported to be in support of\\nthe protests.[111] Later in 2019, some workers accused the company of retaliating against internal\\nactivists.[107]\\n\\nOn March 19, 2019, Google announced that it would enter the video game market, launching a cloud\\ngaming platform called Google Stadia.[112]\\n\\n\\n\\nOn June 3, 2019, the United States Department of Justice reported that it would investigate Google for\\nantitrust violations.[113] This led to the filing of an antitrust lawsuit in October 2020, on the grounds the\\ncompany had abused a monopoly position in the search and search advertising markets.[114]\\n\\nIn December 2019, former PayPal chief operating officer Bill Ready became Google\\'s new commerce\\nchief. Ready\\'s role will not be directly involved with Google Pay.[115]\\n\\nIn April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Google announced several cost-cutting measures. Such\\nmeasures included slowing down hiring for the remainder of 2020, except for a small number of strategic\\nareas, recalibrating the focus and pace of investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non-\\nbusiness essential marketing and travel.[116] Most employees were also working from home due to the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the success of it even led to Google announcing that they would be\\npermanently converting some of their jobs to work from home [117]\\n\\nThe 2020 Google services outages disrupted Google services: one in August that affected Google Drive\\namong others, another in November affecting YouTube, and a third in December affecting the entire suite\\nof Google applications. All three outages were resolved within hours.[118][119][120]\\n\\nIn 2021, the Alphabet Workers Union was founded, composed mostly of Google employees.[121]\\n\\nIn January 2021, the Australian Government proposed legislation that would require Google and\\nFacebook to pay media companies for the right to use their content. In response, Google threatened to\\nclose off access to its search engine in Australia.[122]\\n\\nIn March 2021, Google reportedly paid $20 million for Ubisoft ports on Google Stadia.[123] Google spent\\n\"tens of millions of dollars\" on getting major publishers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two to bring some of\\ntheir biggest games to Stadia.[124]\\n\\nIn April 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google ran a years-long program called \"Project\\nBernanke\" that used data from past advertising bids to gain an advantage over competing for ad services.\\nThis was revealed in documents concerning the antitrust lawsuit filed by ten US states against Google in\\nDecember.[125]\\n\\nIn September 2021, the Australian government announced plans to curb Google\\'s capability to sell\\ntargeted ads, claiming that the company has a monopoly on the market harming publishers, advertisers,\\nand consumers.[126]\\n\\nIn 2022, Google began accepting requests for the removal of phone numbers, physical addresses and\\nemail addresses from its search results. It had previously accepted requests for removing confidential data\\nonly, such as Social Security numbers, bank account and credit card numbers, personal signatures, and\\nmedical records. Even with the new policy, Google may remove information from only certain but not all\\nsearch queries. It would not remove content that is \"broadly useful\", such as news articles, or already part\\nof the public record.[127]\\n\\nIn May 2022, Google announced that the company had acquired California based, MicroLED display\\ntechnology development and manufacturing Start-up company Raxium. Raxium is set to join Google\\'s\\nDevices and Services team to aid in the development of micro-optics, monolithic integration, and system\\nintegration.[128][129]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn December 2022, Google debuted OSV-Scanner,[130][131] a Go tool for finding security holes in open\\nsource software, which pulls from the largest open source vulnerability database of its kind to defend\\nagainst supply chain attacks.\\n\\nFollowing the success of ChatGPT and concerns that Google was falling behind in the AI race, Google\\'s\\nsenior management issued a \"code red\"[132] and a \"directive that all of its most important products—those\\nwith more than a billion users—must incorporate generative AI within months\".[133] In March 2023, in\\ndirect response to the rapid rise of ChatGPT, Google released Bard (now Gemini), a generative artificial\\nintelligence chatbot.[134]\\n\\nIn early May 2023, Google announced its plans to build two additional data centers in Ohio. These\\ncenters, which will be built in Columbus and Lancaster, will power up the company\\'s tools, including AI\\ntechnology. The said data hub will add to the already operational center near Columbus, bringing\\nGoogle\\'s total investment in Ohio to over $2 billion.[135]\\n\\nIn August 2024, Google would lose a lawsuit which started in 2020 in lower court, as it was found that\\nthe company had an illegal monopoly over Internet search.[136] D.C. Circuit Court Judge Amit Mehta\\nheld that this monopoly was in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.[137] In September 2024, the EU\\nCourt of Justice, based in Europe, would also find that Google held an illegal monopoly, in this case with\\nregards to its shopping search, and could not avoid paying a €2.4 billion fine.[138] The EU Court of\\nJustice found that Google\\'s treatment of rival shopping searches, which the court referred to as\\n\"discriminatory\", was in violation of the Digital Markets Act.[138]\\n\\nIn October 2024, Google was fined by a local Russian court a symbolic 2.5 decillion dollars for allegedly\\nblocking pro-Kremlin propaganda. No payment was made.[139]\\n\\nIn November 2024, Google announced the establishment of a new AI hub in Saudi Arabia, aiming to\\nsupport the Kingdom\\'s economic growth and technological development as part of its Vision 2030\\ninitiative. This AI hub is projected to contribute up to $71 billion to Saudi Arabia\\'s economy by\\nadvancing AI-driven solutions tailored to the region\\'s specific needs and training local talent.[140]\\n\\nThe partnership between Google and Saudi Arabia includes collaboration with key stakeholders, such as\\nthe Public Investment Fund (PIF), to develop AI applications that will benefit sectors like healthcare,\\nfinance, oil and gas, and logistics. The initiative focuses on creating localized AI technologies, with an\\nemphasis on integrating Arabic language capabilities and enabling widespread cloud adoption.[141]\\n\\nIn March 2025, Google agreed to acquire Wiz, a New York-based cybersecurity startup focusing on cloud\\ncomputing, for US$32 billion. This cash deal would be Google\\'s biggest ever, as well as it currently being\\nthe most expensive deal of 2025. Alphabet reportedly tried to close a deal for only $23 billion in 2024,\\nbut this fell apart after concerns about regulatory hurdles, among other issues. Wiz, a company located in\\nthe U.S. and Israel, was cofounded in 2020 by Assaf Rappaport. The company is backed by a number of\\nSilicon Valley venture capitalists, as well as notably being partnered with Amazon and Microsoft, as\\nlisted in their website. Google reportedly said \"the deal would help artificial-intelligence companies get\\nbetter security and use more than one cloud service.\"[142]\\n\\nIn July 2025, the United States Department of Defense announced that Google had received a $200\\nmillion contract for AI in the military, along with Anthropic, OpenAI, and xAI.[143]\\n\\n\\n\\nProducts and services\\n\\nSearch engine\\nGoogle indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the\\nuse of keywords and operators.[144] According to comScore market research from November 2009,\\nGoogle Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a market share of\\n65.6%.[145] In May 2017, Google enabled a new \"Personal\" tab in Google Search, letting users search for\\ncontent in their Google accounts\\' various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from\\nGoogle Photos.[146][147]\\n\\nGoogle launched its Google News service in 2002, an automated service which summarizes news articles\\nfrom various websites.[148] Google also hosts Google Books, a service which searches the text found in\\nbooks in its database and shows limited previews or and the full book where allowed.[149]\\n\\nGoogle expanded its search services to include shopping (launched originally as Froogle in 2002),[150]\\n\\nfinance (launched 2006),[151] and flights (launched 2011).[152]\\n\\nAdvertising\\nGoogle generates most of its revenues from advertising. This\\nincludes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content\\nproducts on Google and YouTube, Android and licensing and\\nservice fees, including fees received for Google Cloud\\nofferings. Forty-six percent of this profit was from clicks\\n(cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017.\\nThis includes three principal methods, namely AdMob,\\nAdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search,\\netc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.[153] In addition to its\\nown algorithms for understanding search requests, Google Google at ad-tech London, 2010\\nuses technology from its acquisition of DoubleClick, to\\nproject user interest and target advertising to the search\\ncontext and the user history.[154][155] In 2007, Google launched \"AdSense for Mobile\", taking advantage\\nof the emerging mobile advertising market.[156]\\n\\nGoogle Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by\\nexamining click rates for all the links on a page.[157] Google advertisements can be placed on third-party\\nwebsites in a two-part program. Google Ads allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the\\nGoogle content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.[158] The sister service, Google AdSense,\\nallows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads\\nare clicked.[159] One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud, which occurs when\\na person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the\\nadvertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to\\n\\n\\n\\n20\\xa0 percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.[160] Google Search Console (rebranded from Google\\nWebmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security\\nissues of their websites, as well as optimize their website\\'s visibility.\\n\\nGenerative artificial intelligence\\nGoogle had previously used virtual assistants and chatbots, such as Google Bard, prior to the\\nannouncement of Gemini in March 2024. None of them, however, had been seen as legitimate\\ncompetitors to ChatGPT, unlike Gemini.[161] An AI training program for Google employees was also\\nintroduced in April 2024.[162]\\n\\nGoogle has created the text-to-image model Imagen,[163] and the text-to-video model Veo.[164] In 2025,\\nGoogle announced SynthID Detector, a tool that uses watermarking to identify whether content such as\\ntext, images, audio, or video was generated using Google products.[165]\\n\\nIn 2023, Google released NotebookLM, an online tool for synthesizing documents using Gemini. In\\nSeptember 2024, it gained attention for its \"Audio Overview\" feature, which generates podcast-like\\nsummaries of documents.[166][167] Google also developed LearnLM, a family of language models serving\\nas personal AI tutors.[168]\\n\\nConsumer services\\n\\nWeb-based services\\nGoogle offers Gmail for email,[169] Google Calendar for time-management and scheduling,[170] Google\\nMaps and Google Earth for mapping, navigation and satellite imagery,[171] Google Drive for cloud\\nstorage of files,[172] Google Docs, Sheets and Slides for productivity,[172] Google Photos for photo\\nstorage and sharing,[173] Google Keep for note-taking,[174] Google Translate for language translation,[175]\\n\\nYouTube for video viewing and sharing,[176] Google My Business for managing public business\\ninformation,[177] Google Classroom for managing assignments and communication in education,[178] and\\nDuo for social interaction.[179] A job search product has also existed since before 2017,[180][181][182]\\n\\nGoogle for Jobs is an enhanced search feature that aggregates listings from job boards and career\\nsites.[183] Google Earth, launched in 2005, allows users to see high-definition satellite pictures from all\\nover the world for free through a client software downloaded to their computers.[184]\\n\\nSoftware\\nGoogle develops the Android mobile operating system,[185] as well as its smartwatch,[186] television,[187]\\n\\ncar,[188] and Internet of things-enabled smart devices variations.[189] It also develops the Google Chrome\\nweb browser,[190] and ChromeOS, an operating system based on Chrome.[191]\\n\\nHardware\\nIn January 2010, Google released Nexus One, the first Android phone under its own brand.[192] It\\nspawned a number of phones and tablets under the \"Nexus\" branding[193] until its eventual\\ndiscontinuation in 2016, replaced by a new brand called Pixel.[194]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2011, the Chromebook was introduced, which runs on\\nChromeOS.[195]\\n\\nIn July 2013, Google introduced the Chromecast dongle, which allows\\nusers to stream content from their smartphones to televisions.[196][197]\\n\\nIn June 2014, Google announced Google Cardboard, a simple cardboard\\nviewer that lets the user place their smartphone in a special front\\ncompartment to view virtual reality (VR) media.[198]\\n\\nIn October 2016, Google announced Daydream View, a lightweight VR Google Pixel smartphones on\\nviewer which lets the user place their smartphone in the front hinge to display in a store\\nview VR media.[199][200]\\n\\nOther hardware products include:\\n\\nNest, a series of voice assistant smart speakers that can answer voice queries, play music,\\nfind information from apps (calendar, weather etc.), and control third-party smart home\\nappliances (users can tell it to turn on the lights, for example).

At IPO, the company offered\\n19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[68][69] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market\\ncapitalization of more than $23 billion.[72] The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting\\n$350 for the first time on October 31, 2007,[222] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the\\nonline advertising market.[223] The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as\\nopposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds.[223] GOOG shares split into GOOG class C\\nshares and GOOGL class A shares.[224] The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the\\nticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol\\nGGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google\\'s holding company, since the fourth\\nquarter of 2015.[225]\\n\\nIn the third quarter of 2005, Google reported a 700% increase in profit, largely due to large companies\\nshifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the\\nInternet.[226][227][228]\\n\\nFor the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only\\n$112 million in licensing and other revenues.[229] In 2011, 96% of Google\\'s revenue was derived from its\\nadvertising programs.[230]\\n\\nGoogle generated $50 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2012, generating $38 billion the\\nprevious year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, \"We ended 2012 with a strong quarter\\n... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues\\n\\n\\n\\nfor the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half.\"[231]\\n\\nGoogle\\'s consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89\\nbillion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.[232] Google\\'s Internet business was\\nresponsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users\\' clicks on\\nadvertisements.[233] By January 2014, Google\\'s market capitalization had grown to $397 billion.[234]\\n\\nTax avoidance strategies\\nGoogle uses various tax avoidance strategies. On the list of largest technology companies by revenue, it\\npays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1\\nbillion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through Ireland and the Netherlands and then to Bermuda.\\nSuch techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in, for\\ninstance, the UK is 28 per cent.[235] This reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google\\'s transfer\\npricing practices in 2012.[236]\\n\\nIn 2020, Google said it had overhauled its controversial global tax structure and consolidated all of its\\nintellectual property holdings back to the U.S.[237]\\n\\nGoogle Vice-president Matt Brittin testified to the Public Accounts Committee of the UK House of\\nCommons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.[238] In January\\n2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in\\nfuture.[239] In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax\\nbill.[240]\\n\\nIn 2013, Google ranked 5th in lobbying spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked\\n2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.[241]\\n\\nCorporate identity\\nThe name \"Google\" originated from a misspelling of\\n\"googol\",[242][243] which refers to the number represented by a 1\\nfollowed by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their original\\npaper on PageRank:[36] \"We chose our system name, Google, because\\nit is a common spelling of googol, or 10100[,] and fits well with our Google\\'s logo from 2013 to\\n\\n2015. The logo had been used\\ngoal of building very large-scale search engines.\" Having found its with minor changes since 1999.\\nway increasingly into everyday language, the verb \"google\" was\\nadded to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford\\nEnglish Dictionary in 2006, meaning \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the\\nInternet.\"[244][64] Google\\'s mission statement, from the outset, was \"to organize the world\\'s information\\nand make it universally accessible and useful\",[245] and its unofficial slogan is \"Don\\'t be evil\".[246] In\\nOctober 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: \"Do\\nthe right thing\".[247] The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary\\nof Alphabet.\\n\\nThe original Google logo was designed by Sergey Brin.[248] Since 1998, Google has been designing\\nspecial, temporary alternate logos to place on their homepage intended to celebrate holidays, events,\\nachievements and people. The first Google Doodle was in honor of the Burning Man Festival of\\n\\n\\n\\n1998.[249][250] The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in\\ncase the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry\\nand Sergey asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000. From that point\\nonward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed \"Doodlers\".[251]\\n\\nGoogle has a tradition of creating April Fools\\' Day jokes. Its first on April 1, 2000, was Google\\nMentalPlex which allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.[252] In 2007, Google\\nannounced a free Internet service called TiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a\\nconnection by flushing one end of a fiber-optic cable down their toilet.[253]\\n\\nGoogle\\'s services contain easter eggs, such as the Swedish Chef\\'s \"Bork bork bork\", Pig Latin, \"Hacker\"\\nor leetspeak, Elmer Fudd, Pirate, and Klingon as language selections for its search engine.[254] When\\nsearching for the word \"anagram\", meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid\\nwords, Google\\'s suggestion feature displays \"Did you mean: nag a ram?\"[255] Since 2019, Google runs\\nfree online courses to help engineers learn how to plan and author technical documentation better.[256]\\n\\nWorkplace culture\\nOn Fortune magazine\\'s list of the best companies to work for,\\nGoogle ranked first in 2007, 2008 and 2012,[257][258][259] and\\nfourth in 2009 and 2010.[260][261] Google was also nominated\\nin 2010 to be the world\\'s most attractive employer to\\ngraduating students in the Universum Communications talent\\nattraction index.[262] Google\\'s corporate philosophy includes\\nprinciples such as \"you can make money without doing evil\",\\n\"you can be serious without a suit\", and \"work should be\\nchallenging and the challenge should be fun\".[263]\\n\\nGoogle employees marching in the Pride\\nin London parade in 2016\\n\\nAs of September\\xa0 30, 2020, Alphabet Inc. had 132,121\\nemployees,[264] of which more than 100,000 worked for\\nGoogle.[8] Google\\'s 2020 diversity report states that 32 percent of its workforce are women and 68\\npercent are men, with the ethnicity of its workforce being predominantly white (51.7%) and Asian\\n(41.9%).[265] Within tech roles, 23.6 percent were women; and 26.7 percent of leadership roles were held\\nby women.[266] In addition to its 100,000+ full-time employees, Google used about 121,000 temporary\\nworkers and contractors, as of March\\xa02019.[8]\\n\\nGoogle\\'s employees are hired based on a hierarchical system. Employees are split into six hierarchies\\nbased on experience and can range \"from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and\\nexperienced engineers at level six\".[267] As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as\\nInnovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on\\nprojects that interest them. Some of Google\\'s services, such as Gmail, Google News, Orkut, and AdSense,\\noriginated from these independent endeavors.[268] In a talk at Stanford University, Marissa Mayer,\\nGoogle\\'s vice-president of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all\\nnew product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.[269]\\n\\nIn 2005, articles in The New York Times[270] and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its\\nanti-corporate, no evil philosophy.[271][272][273] In an effort to maintain the company\\'s unique culture,\\nGoogle designated a Chief Culture Officer whose purpose was to develop and maintain the culture and\\n\\n\\n\\nwork on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on.[274] Google has also\\nfaced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees.[275][276] In 2013, a class action against\\nseveral Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged \"no cold call\" agreements\\nwhich restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.[277] In a lawsuit filed January 8, 2018, multiple\\nemployees and job applicants alleged Google discriminated against a class defined by their \"conservative\\npolitical views[,] male gender[,] and/or [...] Caucasian or Asian race\".[278]\\n\\nOn January 25, 2020, the formation of an international workers union of Google employees, Alpha\\nGlobal, was announced.[279] The coalition is made up of \"13 different unions representing workers in 10\\ncountries, including the United States, [the] United Kingdom, and Switzerland\".[280] The group is\\naffiliated with the UNI Global Union, which represents nearly 20 million international workers from\\nvarious unions and federations. The formation of the union is in response to persistent allegations of\\nmistreatment of Google employees and a toxic workplace culture.[280][281][278] Google had previously\\nbeen accused of surveilling and firing employees who were suspected of organizing a workers union.[282]\\n\\nIn 2021, court documents revealed that between 2018 and 2020, Google ran an anti-union campaign\\ncalled Project Vivian to \"convince them (employees) that unions suck\".[283]\\n\\nIn February 2025, Google dropped their commitment to make \"diversity, equity, and inclusion part of\\neverything we do\" from their annual investor report. This action followed Meta, Amazon, Pepsi,\\nMcDonald\\'s, Walmart and others who all have rolled back their DEI programmes.[284]\\n\\nOffice locations\\nGoogle\\'s headquarters in Mountain View, California is\\nreferred to as \"the Googleplex\", a play on words on the\\nnumber googolplex and the headquarters itself being a\\ncomplex of buildings. Internationally, Google has over 78\\noffices in more than 50 countries.[285]\\n\\nIn 2006, Google moved into about 300,000 square feet\\n(27,900\\xa0 m2) of office space at 111 Eighth Avenue in\\nManhattan, New York City. The office houses its largest\\nadvertising sales team.[286] In 2010, Google bought the Google\\'s New York City office building\\n\\nhouses its largest advertising sales team.\\nbuilding housing the headquarter, in a deal that valued the\\nproperty at around $1.9 billion.[287][288] In March 2018,\\nGoogle\\'s parent company Alphabet bought the nearby\\nChelsea Market building for $2.4 billion. The sale is touted as\\none of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single\\nbuilding in the history of New York.[289][290][291][292] In\\nNovember 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its\\nNew York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees.[293]\\n\\nGoogle\\'s Toronto office\\nThe same December, it was announced that a $1 billion,\\n1,700,000-square-foot (160,000\\xa0m2) headquarters for Google\\nwould be built in Manhattan\\'s Hudson Square neighborhood.[294][295] Called Google Hudson Square, the\\nnew campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York\\nCity.[296]\\n\\n\\n\\nBy late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division in Ann Arbor,\\nMichigan.[297] In November 2006, Google opened offices on Carnegie Mellon\\'s campus in Pittsburgh,\\nfocusing on shopping-related advertisement coding and smartphone applications and programs.[298][299]\\n\\nOther office locations in the U.S. include Atlanta; Austin; Boulder, Colorado; Cambridge, Massachusetts;\\nSan Francisco; Seattle and Kirkland, Washington; Birmingham, Michigan; Reston, Virginia, Washington,\\nD.C.,[300] and Madison, Wisconsin.[301]\\n\\nIt also has product research and development operations in\\ncities around the world, namely Sydney (birthplace location\\nof Google Maps)[302] and London (part of Android\\ndevelopment).[303] In November 2013, Google announced\\nplans for a new London headquarter, a 1 million square foot\\noffice able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as\\none of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at\\nthe time of the deal\\'s announcement in January,[304] Google\\nsubmitted plans for the new headquarter to the Camden\\nCouncil in June 2017.[305][306] In May 2015, Google Google\\'s Dublin Ireland office,\\nannounced its intention to create its own campus in headquarters of Google Ads for Europe\\nHyderabad, India. The new campus, reported to be the\\ncompany\\'s largest outside the United States, will\\naccommodate 13,000 employees.[307][308]\\n\\nGoogle\\'s Global Offices sum a total of 86 locations worldwide,[309] with 32 offices in North America,\\nthree of them in Canada and 29 in United States Territory, California being the state with the most\\nGoogle\\'s offices with 9 in total including the Googleplex.

The first cable, named Curie,\\nconnects California with Chile and was completed on November 15, 2019.[316][317] The second fully\\nGoogle-owned undersea cable, named Dunant, connects the United States with France and is planned to\\nbegin operation in 2020.[318] Google\\'s third subsea cable, Equiano, will connect Lisbon (Portugal) with\\nLagos (Nigeria) and Cape Town (South Africa).[319] The company\\'s fourth cable, named Grace Hopper,\\nconnects landing points in New York (US), Bude (UK) and Bilbao (Spain), and is expected to become\\noperational in 2022.[320]\\n\\nEnvironment\\nIn October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of solar panels to provide up to 1.6\\nMegawatt of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus\\' energy needs.[321][322] The\\nsystem is the largest rooftop photovoltaic power station constructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one\\nof the largest on any corporate site in the world.[321] Since 2007, Google has aimed for carbon neutrality\\nin regard to its operations.[323]\\n\\nIn Spring 2009, Google hired a herd of 200 goats for a week from California Grazing to mow their lawn.\\nIt was apparently more eco-friendly.[324]\\n\\nGoogle disclosed in September 2011 that it \"continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000\\nhomes\", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon\\nemissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide\\n\\n\\n\\nelectricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels\\nin 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5\\nmillion watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.[325]\\n\\nIn 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable energy project, putting $38.8\\xa0million\\ninto two wind farms in North Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate\\n169.5\\xa0megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes.[326] In February 2010, the Federal Energy\\nRegulatory Commission granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.[327] The\\ncorporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the\\nelectricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.[328]\\n\\nIn July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of power for 20\\nyears.[329]\\n\\nIn December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it would purchase enough renewable\\nenergy to match 100% of the energy usage of its data centers and offices. The commitment will make\\nGoogle \"the world\\'s largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6\\ngigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy\".[330][331][332]\\n\\nIn November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach\\n100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa\\nand one in Oklahoma.[333] In September 2019, Google\\'s chief executive announced plans for a $2 billion\\nwind and solar investment, the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. This will grow their\\ngreen energy profile by 40%, giving them an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean energy, the company said.[334]\\n\\nIn September 2020, Google announced it had retroactively offset all of its carbon emissions since the\\ncompany\\'s foundation in 1998.[335] It also stated that it is committed to operating its data centers and\\noffices using only carbon-free energy by 2030.[336] In October 2020, the company pledged to make the\\npackaging for its hardware products 100% plastic-free and 100% recyclable by 2025. It also said that all\\nits final assembly manufacturing sites will achieve a UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill certification by\\n2022 by ensuring that the vast majority of waste from the manufacturing process is recycled instead of\\nending up in a landfill.[337]\\n\\nIn 2023 Google consumed 24 TWh of electricity, more than countries such as Iceland, Ghana, the\\nDominican Republic, or Tunisia.[338]\\n\\nClimate change denial and misinformation\\nGoogle donates to climate change denial political groups including the State Policy Network and the\\nCompetitive Enterprise Institute.[339][340] The company also actively funds and profits from climate\\ndisinformation by monetizing ad spaces on most of the largest climate disinformation sites.[341] Google\\ncontinued to monetize and profit from sites propagating climate disinformation even after the company\\nupdated their policy to prohibit placing their ads on similar sites.[342]\\n\\n\\n\\nPhilanthropy\\nIn 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic Google.org, with a start-up fund of\\n$1\\xa0billion.[343] The mission of the organization is to create awareness about climate change, global public\\nhealth, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable plug-in hybrid electric vehicle\\nthat can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired Larry Brilliant as the program\\'s executive director in\\n2004[344] and Megan Smith has since replaced him as director.[345]\\n\\nIn March 2007, in partnership with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), Google hosted\\nthe first Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at its headquarters in Mountain View.[346] In 2011, Google\\ndonated €1 million to International Mathematical Olympiad to support the next five annual International\\nMathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).[347][348] In July 2012, Google launched a \"Legalize Love\"\\ncampaign in support of gay rights.[349]\\n\\nIn 2008, Google announced its \"project 10100\", which accepted ideas for how to help the community and\\nthen allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.[350] After two years of no update, during which\\nmany wondered what had happened to the program,[351] Google revealed the winners of the project,\\ngiving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote\\neducation to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.[352]\\n\\nResponding to the humanitarian crisis after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Google announced a\\n$15 million donation to support Ukrainian citizens.[353] The company also decided to transform its office\\nin Warsaw into a help center for refugees.[354]\\n\\nAlso in February 2022, Google announced a $100 million fund to expand skills training and job\\nplacement for low-income Americans, in conjunction with non-profits Year Up, Social Finance, and Merit\\nAmerica.[355]\\n\\nCriticism and controversies\\nGoogle has had criticism over issues such as aggressive tax\\navoidance,[356] search neutrality, copyright, censorship of\\nsearch results and content,[357] and privacy.[358][359]\\n\\nOther criticisms are alleged misuse and manipulation of\\nsearch results, its use of other people\\'s intellectual property,\\nconcerns that its compilation of data may violate people\\'s\\nprivacy, and the energy consumption of its servers, as well as\\nconcerns over traditional business issues such as monopoly,\\nrestraint of trade, anti-competitive practices, and patent San Francisco activists protest privately\\ninfringement. owned shuttle buses that transport\\n\\nworkers for tech companies such as\\nGoogle from their homes in San\\nFrancisco and Oakland to corporate\\ncampuses in Silicon Valley.\\n\\n\\n\\nPolitical controversy\\n\\nUnited States\\nIn a 2022 National Labor Relations Board ruling, court documents suggested that Google sponsored a\\nsecretive project—Project Vivian—to counsel its employees and to discourage them from forming\\nunions.[283]\\n\\nBrazil\\nOn May 1, 2023, Google placed an ad against anti-disinformation Brazilian Congressional Bill No. 2630,\\nwhich was about to be approved, on its search homepage in Brazil, calling on its users to ask\\ncongressional representatives to oppose the legislation. The country\\'s government and judiciary accused\\nthe company of undue interference in the congressional debate, saying it could amount to abuse of\\neconomic power and ordering the company to change the ad within two hours of notification or face fines\\nof R$1 million\\xa0(2023) (US$185,528.76) per non-compliance hour. The company then promptly removed\\nthe ad.[360][361]\\n\\nIsraeli–Palestinian conflict\\nGoogle is also part of Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion deal in which the technology companies Google and\\nAmazon provide Israel and its military with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other cloud\\ncomputing services, including building local cloud sites that will \"keep information within Israel\\'s\\nborders under strict security guidelines.\"[362][363][364] The contract has been criticized by shareholders\\nand employees over concerns that the project could lead to human rights abuses against Palestinians, in\\nthe context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the disputed status of Palestinian territories.[365][366]\\n\\nAriel Koren, a former marketing manager for Google\\'s educational products and an outspoken critic of\\nthe project, wrote that Google \"systematically silences Palestinian, Jewish, Arab and Muslim voices\\nconcerned about Google\\'s complicity in violations of Palestinian human rights—to the point of formally\\nretaliating against workers and creating an environment of fear\", and said she was retaliated against for\\norganizing against the project.[362][367]\\n\\nIn March 2024, The New York Times reported that Google Photos was being used in a facial recognition\\nprogram by Unit 8200, a surveillance unit of the Israeli Defense Forces, to surveil Palestinians in the\\nGaza Strip amid the Gaza war. A Google spokesman commented that the service \"does not provide\\nidentities for unknown people in photographs\".[368]\\n\\nOn April 18, 2024, Google dismissed 28 employees who participated in protests against the company\\'s\\ninvolvement in Project Nimbus, which the employees argued should not be used for military or\\nintelligence services. The protesting employees, part of the group No Tech For Apartheid, staged sit-ins at\\nGoogle\\'s offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California,[369] leading to disruptions and blockages within\\nthe company facilities.[370][371] This had followed reports of Israeli forces killing large numbers of\\nPalestinian civilians while using own Lavender AI system to identify targets.[372][373]\\n\\nOn July 2025, Sergey Brin said in response to a UN report that used the term \"the genocide in Gaza\" and\\nthat claimed Google profited from it: \"throwing around the term genocide in relation to Gaza is deeply\\noffensive to many Jewish people who have suffered actual genocides. I would also be careful citing\\ntransparently antisemitic organizations like the UN in relation to these issues\".[374][375]\\n\\n\\n\\nRussia\\nOn October 31, 2024, the Russian government imposed a \"symbolic\" fine of $20 decillion on Google for\\nblocking pro-Russian YouTube channels. In 2022, during the invasion of Ukraine, a Russian court had\\nordered Google to restore the channels, with penalties doubling every week according to TASS.[376] This\\ncomes alongside other large fines against social media companies accused of hosting content critical of\\nthe Kremlin or supportive of Ukraine.[377]\\n\\nAntitrust\\nIn July 2018, Mozilla program manager Chris Peterson accused Google of intentionally slowing down\\nYouTube performance on Firefox.[378][379] In April 2019, former Mozilla executive Jonathan Nightingale\\naccused Google of intentionally and systematically sabotaging the Firefox browser over the past decade\\nin order to boost adoption of Google Chrome.[379]\\n\\nIn 2019, a hub for critics of Google dedicated to abstaining from using Google products coalesced in the\\nReddit online community /r/degoogle.[380] The DeGoogle grassroots campaign continues to grow as\\nprivacy activists highlight information about Google products, and the associated incursion on personal\\nprivacy rights by the company.\\n\\nGoogle reportedly paid Apple $22 billion in 2022 to maintain its position as the default search engine on\\nSafari. It marks one of the largest payments between two tech giants in recent years.[381]\\n\\nEuropean Union\\nOn June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of\\n€2.42 billion from the European Union for \"promoting its\\nown shopping comparison service at the top of search\\nresults.\"[382]\\n\\nOn July 18, 2018,[383] the European Commission fined\\nGoogle €4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The\\nabuse of dominants position has been referred to as Google\\'s The European Commission, which\\nconstraint applied to Android device manufacturers and imposed three fines on Google in 2017,\\nnetwork operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices 2018, and 2019\\ngoes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018,\\nGoogle confirmed[384] that it had appealed the fine to the\\nGeneral Court of the European Union.[385]\\n\\nOn March 20, 2019, the European Commission imposed a €1.49 billion ($1.69 billion) fine on Google for\\npreventing rivals from being able to \"compete and innovate fairly\" in the online advertising market.\\nEuropean Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had violated EU antitrust\\nrules by \"imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites\" that required them to\\nexclude search results from Google\\'s rivals.[386][387]\\n\\nOn September 14, 2022, Google lost the appeal of a €4.125 billion (£3.5 billion) fine, which was ruled to\\nbe paid after it was proved by the European Commission that Google forced Android phone-makers to\\ncarry Google\\'s search and web browser apps. Since the initial accusations, Google has changed its\\npolicy.[388]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn March 2024, a former Google software engineer and Chinese national, Linwei Ding, was accused of\\nstealing confidential artificial intelligence information from the company and handing it to Chinese\\ncorporations.[389] Ding had allegedly stolen over 500 files from the company over the course of 5 years,\\nhaving been hired in 2019.[390] Upon discovering Ding had been in contact with Chinese state-owned\\ncompanies, Google notified the FBI, who carried on the investigation of the data breach.[391]\\n\\nOn September 10, 2024, Europe\\'s top court imposed a €2.4 billion fine on Google for abusing its\\ndominance in the shopping comparison market, marking the conclusion of a case that began in 2009 with\\na complaint from British firm Foundem.[392]\\n\\nOn September 18, 2024, Alphabet\\'s Google won a €1.49 billion ($1.7 billion) antitrust fine from the\\nEuropean Union, while Qualcomm\\'s efforts to repeal a penalty were unsuccessful. The General Court\\nagreed with many of the European Commission\\'s findings but annulled the Google fine, stating that the\\nCommission failed to consider all relevant factors and did not demonstrate harm to innovation or\\nconsumers. Google noted that it had already changed its contract practices in 2016. Meanwhile,\\nQualcomm saw its fine reduced slightly but failed to overturn the ruling regarding its predatory pricing\\nagainst Icera. Both companies have options to appeal further.[393]\\n\\nUnited States\\nAfter U.S. Congressional hearings in July 2020,[394] and a report from the U.S. House of Representatives\\'\\nAntitrust Subcommittee released in early October,[395] the United States Department of Justice filed an\\nantitrust lawsuit against Google on October 20, 2020, asserting that it has illegally maintained its\\nmonopoly position in web search and search advertising.[396][397] The lawsuit alleged that Google\\nengaged in anticompetitive behavior by paying Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion to be the default\\nsearch engine on iPhones.[398] Later that month, both Facebook and Alphabet agreed to \"cooperate and\\nassist one another\" in the face of investigation into their online advertising practices.[399][400] Another\\nsuit was brought against Google in 2023 for illegally monopolizing the advertising technology\\nmarket.[401] In August 2024, District of Columbia U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled that\\nGoogle held a monopoly in online search and text advertising in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman\\nAntitrust Act.[402][403]\\n\\nOn October 8, 2024, The U.S. government suggested it could request Google to divest parts of its\\nbusiness, such as the Chrome browser and Android, due to its alleged monopoly in online search. The\\nJustice Department aimed to limit Google\\'s growing dominance in areas like AI. Google, which intended\\nto appeal, argued that the proposals were too extreme, while also dealing with other antitrust cases\\ninvolving its app store and advertising operations.[404]\\n\\nIn November 2024, the Justice Department proposed major changes to curb Google\\'s online search\\nmonopoly, including forcing the company to sell its Chrome browser, share search data with competitors,\\nand end exclusive agreements that make Google the default search engine on devices like iPhones. The\\nDoJ also sought a ban on Google re-entering the browser market for five years and restrictions on its\\ninvestments in rival search or AI technologies. Google called these proposals excessive and harmful to\\nconsumers, pledging to appeal. A trial on the case was scheduled for April 2025, though the incoming\\nadministration and new DoJ leadership could potentially alter the course of the proceedings.[405]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn September 2024, Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) provisionally found that Google engaged\\nin anti-competitive practices in the online advertising technology market, potentially harming thousands\\nof UK publishers and advertisers. The investigation claimed Google used its market power to prevent\\nrivals from competing fairly, affecting billions spent on digital ads. Google rejected the findings as\\nflawed, stating its ad tech benefits businesses. If found guilty, Google could face penalties of up to 10%\\nof its global turnover. Similar investigations are ongoing in the U.S. and EU, where regulators have\\nsuggested that Google may need to sell part of its ad-tech business.[406]\\n\\nIt was ruled in 2025 by US Department of Justice alongside 17 other states that Google operates a\\nmonopoly in online advertising technology. The case will now move to a remedies stage which may lead\\nto Alphabet, the owner of Google, being broken up.[407]\\n\\nGender discrimination lawsuit\\nIn 2017, three women sued Google, accusing the company of violating California\\'s Equal Pay Act by\\nunderpaying its female employees. The lawsuit cited the wage gap was around $17,000 and that Google\\nlocked women into lower career tracks, leading to smaller salaries and bonuses. In June 2022, Google\\nagreed to pay a $118 million settlement to 15,550 female employees working in California since 2013. As\\na part of the settlement, Google also agreed to hire a third party to analyze its hiring and compensation\\npractices.[408][409][410]\\n\\nCensorship\\nAccording to Ryan Gallagher of The Intercept in August 2018, Google was developing for the People\\'s\\nRepublic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as Dragonfly) \"that will blacklist\\nwebsites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest\".[411] Google\\nwas grilled at a Senate committee hearing on the project one month later.[412][413] The project was\\ncanceled in December following the backlash it garnered both externally and internally within the\\ncompany.[414][415]\\n\\nData loss\\nIn May 2024, a misconfiguration in Google Cloud led to the accidental deletion of UniSuper\\'s $135\\nbillion Australian pension fund account, affecting over half a million members who were unable to access\\ntheir accounts for a week. The outage, attributed to a cloud service error and not a cyberattack, prompted\\na joint apology from UniSuper and Google Cloud executives, who assured members that no personal data\\nwas compromised and restoration efforts were underway.[416]\\n\\nData privacy\\nOn October 8, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Google and Alphabet due to \"non-public\"\\nGoogle+ account data being exposed as a result of a bug that allowed app developers to gain access to the\\nprivate information of users. The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million with a payout to\\nclaimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12 each.[417][418][419]\\n\\n\\n\\nOn January 21, 2019, French data regulator CNIL imposed a record €50 million fine on Google for\\nbreaching the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation. The judgment claimed Google had\\nfailed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google\\nissued a statement saying it was \"deeply committed\" to transparency and was \"studying the decision\"\\nbefore determining its response.[420]\\n\\nIn November 2019, the Office for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human\\nServices began investigation into Project Nightingale, to assess whether the \"mass collection of\\nindividuals\\' medical records\" complied with HIPAA.[421] According to The Wall Street Journal, Google\\nsecretively began the project in 2018, with St. Louis-based healthcare company Ascension.[422]\\n\\nIn early June 2020, a $5 billion class-action lawsuit was filed against Google by a group of consumers,\\nalleging that Chrome\\'s Incognito browsing mode still collects their user history.[423][424] The lawsuit\\nbecame known in March 2021 when a federal judge denied Google\\'s request to dismiss the case, ruling\\nthat they must face the group\\'s charges.[425][426] Reuters reported that the lawsuit alleged that Google\\'s\\nCEO Sundar Pichai sought to keep the users unaware of this issue.[427] In April 2024, it was announced\\nthat Google agreed to settle this lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement Google agreed to destroy\\nbillions of data records to settle a lawsuit claiming it secretly tracked the internet use of people who\\nthought they were browsing privately.[428]\\n\\nOn January 6, 2022, France\\'s data privacy regulatory body CNIL fined Alphabet\\'s Google 150 million\\neuros (US$169 million) for not allowing its Internet users an easy refusal of cookies along with\\nFacebook.[429]\\n\\nIn August 2024, Google sent an email to users informing them of its legal obligation to disclose certain\\nconfidential information to U.S. government authorities. The company stated that when it receives valid\\nrequests from government agencies to produce documents without redacting confidential customer\\ninformation, it may produce such documents even if they are confidential to users. However, it will\\nrequest confidential treatment of such information from the government.[430]\\n\\nIn January 2025, U.S. federal judge Richard Seeborg rejected Google\\'s motion to dismiss a class-action\\nlawsuit. The lawsuit claims Google collected data from users who had specifically opted out of tracking.\\nThe trial is scheduled for August 2025.[431]\\n\\nGeolocation\\nGoogle has been criticized for continuing to collect location data from users who had turned off location-\\nsharing settings.[432] In 2020, the FBI used a geofence warrant to request data from Google about\\nAndroid devices near the Seattle Police Officers Guild building following an arson attempt during Black\\nLives Matter protests. Google provided anonymized location data from devices in the area, which raised\\nprivacy concerns due to the potential inclusion of unrelated protesters.[433]\\n\\nCopyright infringement\\nOn March 20, 2024, Google was fined approximately $270 million by French regulators for using content\\nfrom news outlets in France without proper disclosure to train its AI, Bard, now renamed Gemini,\\nviolating a previous commitment to negotiate content use transparently and fairly.[434]\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. government contracts\\nFollowing media reports about PRISM, the NSA\\'s massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013,\\nseveral technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.[435] According to\\nunnamed sources, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009, as YouTube in 2010.[436]\\n\\nGoogle has worked with the United States Department of Defense on drone software through the 2017\\nProject Maven that could be used to improve the accuracy of drone strikes.[437] In April 2018, thousands\\nof Google employees, including senior engineers, signed a letter urging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to\\nend this controversial contract with the Pentagon.[438] Google ultimately decided not to renew this DoD\\ncontract, which was set to expire in 2019.[439]\\n\\nIn 2022 Google shared a $9 billion contract from the Pentagon for cloud computing with Amazon,\\nMicrosoft, and Oracle.[440]\\n\\nSee also\\nOutline of Google Google ATAP\\nGooglization\\n\\nNotes\\na.

SpaceX is also developing its own space suit and astronaut via its Polaris\\nprogram[13] as well as developing the human lander for lunar missions under NASA\\'s Artemis\\nprogram.[14] SpaceX is not publicly traded; a space industry newspaper estimated that SpaceX has a\\nrevenue of over $10 billion in 2024.[4]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n2001–2004: Founding\\nIn early 2001, Elon Musk met Robert Zubrin and donated $100,000 to his Mars Society, joining its board\\nof directors for a short time.[15]:\\u200a30–31\\u200a He gave a plenary talk at their fourth convention where he\\nannounced Mars Oasis, a project to land a greenhouse and grow plants on Mars.[16][17] Musk initially\\nattempted to acquire a Dnepr launch vehicle for the project through Russian contacts from Jim\\nCantrell[18].\\n\\nMusk returned with his team to Moscow, this time bringing Michael Griffin, who later became the 11th\\nAdministrator of NASA, but found the Russians increasingly unreceptive.[19][20] On the flight home,\\nMusk announced he could start a company to build the affordable rockets they needed instead.[20] By\\napplying vertical integration,[19] using inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf components when\\npossible,[20] and adopting the modular approach of modern software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX\\ncould significantly cut launch costs.[20]\\n\\nIn early 2002, Elon Musk started to look for staff for his company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk\\napproached five people for the initial positions at the fledgling company, including Griffin, who declined\\nthe position of Chief Engineer,[21]:\\u200a11\\u200a Jim Cantrell and John Garvey (Cantrell and Garvey later founded\\nthe company Vector Launch), rocket engineer Tom Mueller, and Chris Thompson.[21][22] SpaceX was\\nfirst headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. Early SpaceX employees, such as Tom\\nMueller (CTO), Gwynne Shotwell (COO), and Chris Thompson (VP of Operations), came from\\nneighboring TRW and Boeing corporations. By November 2005, the company had 160 employees.[23]\\n\\nMusk personally interviewed and approved all of SpaceX\\'s early employees.[21]:\\u200a22\\u200a\\n\\nMusk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of\\naccess to space, ultimately by a factor of ten.[24]\\n\\n\\n\\n2005–2009: Falcon 1 and first orbital launches\\nSpaceX developed its first orbital launch vehicle, the Falcon\\n1, with internal funding.[25][26] The Falcon 1 was an\\nexpendable two-stage-to-orbit small-lift launch vehicle. The\\ntotal development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately\\n$90\\xa0million[27] to $100\\xa0million.[21]:\\u200a215\\u200a\\n\\nThe Falcon rocket series was named after Star Wars \\'s\\nMillennium Falcon fictional spacecraft.[28]\\n\\nIn 2004, SpaceX protested against NASA to the Government\\nAccountability Office (GAO) because of a sole-source The first successful Falcon 1 launch in\\n\\nSeptember 2008\\ncontract awarded to Kistler Aerospace. Before the GAO could\\nrespond, NASA withdrew the contract, and formed the COTS\\nprogram.[21]:\\u200a109–110\\u200a[29] In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a human-rated commercial space\\nprogram through the end of the decade, a program that would later become the Dragon spacecraft.[30] In\\n2006, the company was selected by NASA and awarded $396\\xa0million to provide crew and cargo resupply\\ndemonstration contracts to the International Space Station (ISS) under the COTS program.[31]\\n\\nThe first two Falcon 1 launches were purchased by the United States Department of Defense under the\\nDARPA Falcon Project which evaluated new U.S. launch vehicles suitable for use in hypersonic missile\\ndelivery for Prompt Global Strike.[26][32][33] The first three launches of the rocket, between 2006 and\\n2008, all resulted in failures, which almost ended the company. Financing for Tesla Motors had failed, as\\nwell,[34] and consequently Tesla, SolarCity, and Musk personally were all nearly bankrupt at the same\\ntime.[21]:\\u200a178–182\\u200a Musk was reportedly \"waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain\" because\\nof the stress.[21]:\\u200a216\\u200a\\n\\nThe financial situation started to turn around with the first successful launch achieved on the fourth\\nattempt on September 28, 2008. Musk split his remaining $30\\xa0million between SpaceX and Tesla, and\\nNASA awarded the first Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract awarding $1.6\\xa0billion to SpaceX\\nin December, thus financially saving the company.[21]:\\u200a217–221\\u200a Based on these factors and the further\\nbusiness operations they enabled, the Falcon 1 was soon retired following its second successful, and fifth\\ntotal, launch in July 2009. This allowed SpaceX to focus company resources on the development of a\\nlarger orbital rocket, the Falcon 9.[35] Gwynne Shotwell was also promoted to company president at the\\ntime, for her role in successfully negotiating the CRS contract with the NASA Associate Administrator\\nBill Gerstenmaier.[36][21]:\\u200a222\\u200a\\n\\n2010–2012: Falcon 9, Dragon, and NASA contracts\\nSpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity\\nvehicle, the Falcon 5.[37] The company instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of the\\nFalcon 9, a reusable heavier lift vehicle. Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated by NASA, which\\ncommitted to purchasing several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This\\nstarted with seed money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in\\n2006.[38] The overall contract award was $278\\xa0million to provide development funding for the Dragon\\n\\n\\n\\nspacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9\\nwith Dragon.[38] As part of this contract, the Falcon 9\\nlaunched for the first time in June 2010 with the Dragon\\nSpacecraft Qualification Unit, using a mockup of the Dragon\\nspacecraft.\\n\\nThe first operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in\\nDecember 2010 aboard COTS Demo Flight 1, the Falcon 9\\'s 0:00\\n\\nsecond flight, and safely returned to Earth after two orbits,\\ncompleting all its mission objectives.[39] By December 2010,\\nthe SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 Video of the first launch of Falcon 9\\n\\nand Dragon every three months.[40]\\n\\nIn April 2011, as part of its second-round Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, NASA\\nissued a $75\\xa0million contract for SpaceX to develop an integrated launch escape system for Dragon in\\npreparation for human-rating it as a crew transport vehicle to the ISS.[41] NASA awarded SpaceX a fixed-\\nprice Space Act Agreement (SAA) to produce a detailed design of the crew transportation system in\\nAugust 2012.[42]\\n\\nIn early 2012, approximately two-thirds of SpaceX stock was owned by Musk[43] and his seventy million\\nshares were then estimated to be worth $875\\xa0 million on private markets,[44] valuing SpaceX at\\n$1.3\\xa0 billion.[45] In May 2012, with the Dragon C2+ launch, Dragon became the first commercial\\nspacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.[46] After the flight, the company private\\nequity valuation nearly doubled to $2.4\\xa0billion or $20/share.[47][48] By that time, SpaceX had operated on\\ntotal funding of approximately $1\\xa0 billion over its first decade of operation. Of this, private equity\\nprovided approximately $200\\xa0 million, with Musk investing approximately $100\\xa0 million and other\\ninvestors having put in about $100\\xa0million.[49]\\n\\nSpaceX\\'s active reusability test program began in late 2012 with testing low-altitude, low-speed aspects\\nof the landing technology.[50] The Falcon 9 prototypes performed vertical takeoffs and landings (VTOL).\\nHigh-velocity, high-altitude tests of the booster atmospheric return technology began in late 2013.[50]\\n\\n2013–2015: Commercial launches and rapid growth\\nSpaceX launched the first commercial mission for a private customer in 2013. In 2014, SpaceX won nine\\ncontracts out of the 20 that were openly competed worldwide.[51] That year Arianespace requested that\\nEuropean governments provide additional subsidies to face the competition from SpaceX.[52][53]\\n\\nBeginning in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing also began to affect the market for launch of U.S.\\nmilitary payloads, which for nearly a decade had been dominated by the large U.S. launch provider\\nUnited Launch Alliance (ULA).[54] The monopoly had allowed launch costs by the U.S. provider to rise\\nto over $400\\xa0million over the years.[55] In September 2014, NASA\\'s Director of Commercial Spaceflight,\\nKevin Crigler, awarded SpaceX the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract to\\nfinalize the development of the Crew Transportation System. The contract included several technical and\\ncertification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six operational missions after\\ncertification.[42]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn January 2015, SpaceX raised $1\\xa0billion in funding from Google and\\nFidelity Investments, in exchange for 8.33% of the company,\\nestablishing the company valuation at approximately $12\\xa0 billion.[56]\\n\\nThe same month SpaceX announced the development of a new satellite\\nconstellation, called Starlink, to provide global broadband internet\\nservice with 4,000 satellites.[57]\\n\\nThe Falcon 9 had its first major failure in late June 2015, when the\\nseventh ISS resupply mission, CRS-7 exploded two minutes into the\\nflight. The problem was traced to a failed two-foot-long steel strut that\\nheld a helium pressure vessel, which broke free due to the force of\\nacceleration. This caused a breach and allowed high-pressure helium to\\nescape into the low-pressure propellant tank, causing the failure.[58]\\n\\n2015–2017: Reusability milestones Launch of Falcon 9 carrying\\nORBCOMM OG2-M1, July\\n\\nSpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage 2014\\nin December 2015 with Falcon 9 Flight 20.[59] In April 2016, the\\ncompany achieved the first successful landing on the\\nautonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS) Of Course I Still\\nLove You in the Atlantic Ocean.[60] By October 2016,\\nfollowing the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they\\nwere offering their customers a 10% price discount if they\\nchoose to fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9 first\\nstage.[61]\\n\\nA second major rocket failure happened in early September\\n2016, when a Falcon 9 exploded during a propellant fill Falcon 9 first stage on an autonomous\\noperation for a standard pre-launch static fire test. The spaceport drone ship (ASDS) barge after\\n\\npayload, the AMOS-6 communications satellite valued at the first successful landing at sea,\\n\\n$200\\xa0million, was destroyed.[62] The explosion was caused by SpaceX CRS-8 mission\\n\\nthe liquid oxygen that is used as propellant turning so cold\\nthat it solidified and ignited with carbon composite helium vessels.[63] Though not considered an\\nunsuccessful flight, the rocket explosion sent the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it\\nworked out what went wrong. SpaceX returned to flight in January 2017.[64]\\n\\nIn March 2017, SpaceX launched a returned Falcon 9 for the SES-10 satellite. This was the first time a\\nre-launch of a payload-carrying orbital rocket went back to space.[65] The first stage was recovered again,\\nalso making it the first landing of a reused orbital class rocket.[66]\\n\\n2017–2018: Leading global commercial launch provider\\nIn July 2017, the company raised $350\\xa0 million, which raised its valuation to $21\\xa0 billion.[67] In 2017,\\nSpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch contracts.[68] By March\\n2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest representing about $12\\xa0 billion in contract\\nrevenue.[69] The contracts included both commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers.[70] This\\nmade SpaceX the leading global commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches.[71]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2017, SpaceX formed a subsidiary, The Boring Company,[72] and began work to construct a short test\\ntunnel on and adjacent to the SpaceX headquarters and manufacturing facility, using a small number of\\nSpaceX employees,[73] which was completed in May 2018,[74] and opened to the public in December\\n2018.[75] During 2018, The Boring Company was spun out into a separate corporate entity with 6% of the\\nequity going to SpaceX, less than 10% to early employees, and the remainder of the equity to Elon\\nMusk.[75]\\n\\nSince 2019: Starship, first crewed launches, Starlink and general\\nIn 2019 SpaceX raised $1.33\\xa0 billion of capital across three funding rounds.[76] By May 2019, the\\nvaluation of SpaceX had risen to $33.3\\xa0billion[77] and reached $36\\xa0billion by March 2020.[78]\\n\\nOn August 19, 2020, after a $1.9\\xa0billion funding round, one of the largest single fundraising pushes by\\nany privately held company, SpaceX\\'s valuation increased to $46\\xa0billion.[79][80][81]\\n\\nIn February 2021, SpaceX raised an additional $1.61\\xa0billion in an equity round from 99 investors[82] at a\\nper share value of approximately $420,[81] raising the company valuation to approximately $74\\xa0billion.\\nBy 2021, SpaceX had raised more than $6\\xa0billion in equity financing. Most of the capital raised since\\n2019 has been used to support the operational fielding of the Starlink satellite constellation and the\\ndevelopment and manufacture of the Starship launch vehicle.[82] By October 2021, the valuation of\\nSpaceX had risen to $100.3\\xa0billion.[83] On April 16, 2021, Starship HLS won a contract to play a critical\\nrole in the NASA crewed spaceflight Artemis program.[84] By 2021, SpaceX had entered into agreements\\nwith Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure to provide on-ground computer and networking\\nservices for Starlink.[85] A new round of financing in 2022 valued SpaceX at $127\\xa0billion.[86]\\n\\nIn July 2021, SpaceX unveiled another drone ship named A Shortfall of Gravitas, landing a booster from\\nCRS-23 on it for the first time on August 29, 2021.[87] Within the first 130 days of 2022, SpaceX had 18\\nrocket launches and two astronaut splashdowns. On December 13, 2021, company CEO Elon Musk\\nannounced that the company was starting a carbon dioxide removal program that would convert captured\\ncarbon into rocket fuel,[88][89] after he announced a $100\\xa0million donation to the X Prize Foundation the\\nprevious February to provide the monetary rewards to winners in a contest to develop the best carbon\\ncapture technology.[90][91]\\n\\nIn August 2022, Reuters reported that the European Space Agency (ESA) began initial discussions with\\nSpaceX that could lead to the company\\'s launchers being used temporarily, given that Russia blocked\\naccess to Soyuz rockets amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[92] Since that invasion and in the greater\\nwar between Russia and Ukraine, Starlink was extensively used.[93]\\n\\nIn 2022, SpaceX\\'s Falcon 9 also became the world record holder for the most launches of a single vehicle\\ntype in a single year.[94][95] SpaceX launched a rocket approximately every six days in 2022, with 61\\nlaunches in total. All but one (a Falcon Heavy in November) was on a Falcon 9 rocket.[94]\\n\\nIn November 2023, SpaceX announced it would acquire its parachute supplier Pioneer Aerospace out of\\nbankruptcy for $2.2 million.[96][97]\\n\\nOn July 16, 2024, Elon Musk posted on X that SpaceX would move its headquarters from Hawthorne,\\nCalifornia, to SpaceX Starbase in Brownsville, Texas. Musk said this was because the recently passed\\nCalifornia AB1955 bill \"and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies\".[98]\\n\\n\\n\\nThis new law in California bans school districts from requiring that teachers notify parents about changes\\nto a student\\'s sexual orientation and gender identity.[99] The headquarters officially moved to\\nBrownsville, Texas in August 2024, according to records filed with the California Secretary of State.[100]\\n\\nThe move to relocate SpaceX\\'s headquarters was seen as largely symbolic, at least in the short term. The\\nHawthorne facility continues to support the company\\'s Falcon launch vehicles, which was SpaceX\\'s\\nworkhorse product in 2024.[101]\\n\\nSpaceX\\'s 2024 Polaris Dawn mission featured the first-ever private spacewalk, marking a major\\nmilestone in commercial space exploration.[102]\\n\\nIn 2025 ProPublica reported that Chinese investors were investing in SpaceX via offshore entities, such\\nas the Cayman Islands. Experts speculated that this might raise national security concerns with\\nregulators.[103]\\n\\nBy July 2025, as part of $5 Billion equity raise SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI.[104]\\n\\nStarship\\nIn January 2019, SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce to help finance the Starship\\nand Starlink projects.[105] The purpose of the Starship vehicle is to enable large-scale transit of humans\\nand cargo to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.[106] SpaceX\\'s Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket\\never flown, with a planned payload capacity of 100+ tons.[107][108] Construction of initial prototypes and\\ntests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas. All Starship construction and testing moved\\nto the new SpaceX South Texas launch site later that year.\\n\\nOn April 20, 2023, Starship\\'s first orbital flight test ended in a mid-air explosion over the Gulf of Mexico\\nbefore booster separation. After launch, multiple engines in the booster progressively failed, causing the\\nvehicle to reach max q later than planned. \"Max q\" is the theoretical point of maximal mechanical stress\\nwhich occurs during the launch sequence of a space vehicle. In the case of a rocket that must be self-\\ndestructed during its ascent, max q occurs at the point of self-destruction. Eventually, the vehicle lost\\ncontrol and spun erratically until the automated flight termination system was activated, which\\nintentionally destroyed the rocket. Elon Musk, SpaceX, and other individuals familiar with the space\\nindustry have referred to the test flight as a success.[109][110]\\n\\nMusk said at the time that it would take \"six to eight weeks\" to get the infrastructure prepared for another\\nlaunch. In October 2023, a senior SpaceX executive stated the company had been ready to launch the\\nnext test flight since September. He accused government regulators of disrupting the project\\'s progress,\\nadding the delay could lead to China beating U.S. astronauts back to the Moon.[111][112]\\n\\nOn November 18, 2023, SpaceX launched Starship on its second flight test, with both vehicles flying for\\na few minutes before separately exploding.[113][114][115][116]\\n\\nIn early March 2024 SpaceX announced that it was targeting March 14 as the tentative launch date for its\\nnext uncrewed Starship launch configuration flight test, pending the issuance of a \"launch license\" by the\\nFAA. This license was granted on March 13, 2024.[117] On March 14, 2024, at 13:25 UTC, Starship\\n\\n\\n\\nlaunched for the third time and for the first time Starship reached its\\nplanned suborbital trajectory. The flight ended with the booster\\nexperiencing a malfunction shortly before landing and the ship being\\nlost during re-entry over the Indian Ocean.[107][108]\\n\\nOn June 4, 2024, SpaceX received the launch license for Starship\\'s\\nfourth flight test. The licensure itself was notable in that it was the first\\ntime that the FAA included a clause that would allow SpaceX to launch\\nsubsequent test flights without a mishap investigation, provided that\\nthey met a similar launch profile and used the same specification of\\nhardware. The provision could prove to speed the development\\ntimeline.[118]\\n\\nOn October 12, 2024, SpaceX received FAA approval for Starship\\'s\\nfifth flight test.[119] The flight was the first without engine failures, and\\nthe first successful tower catch.[120]\\n\\nSpaceX launched Starship on its sixth flight test on November 19,\\n2024.[121] The booster aborted the catch attempt, while the ship\\nconducted a relight in space.[122][123]\\n\\nOn January 16, 2025, SpaceX launched Starship on its seventh flight\\ntest, with the first Block 2 Ship, Ship 33 (standing at 403\\xa0 ft or 123\\nmeters). This test also carried a demonstration payload, a Starlink V3\\nsimulator. The test launched at 22:37 UTC. The test resulted in the\\nsecond catch of the Super Heavy booster, B14, but after 8 minutes,\\nSpaceX lost contact with \\'Ship\\', which is the upper stage of the Starship\\nwhich resulted in the failure of the ship during the ascent. The\\nspacecraft reportedly exploded around 8.5 minutes after launch over\\nthe Atlantic Ocean near the Turks and Caicos Islands. The FAA, on Starship in launch position\\nJanuary 18, required a mishap investigation of the failure.[124]\\n\\nOn March 7, 2025, SpaceX launched another Starship rocket,\\nthis time from Texas. Contact was lost minutes into the test\\nflight and the spacecraft came tumbling down and broke\\napart, with wreckage seen across Florida\\'s skies.[125] As per\\npreliminary investigation, Starship’s 7th test flight was\\ndisrupted by an oxygen leak, flashes and sustained fires in its\\naft section, which caused the rocket’s engines to shut down\\nand turn on the spacecraft’s self-destruct system.[126]\\n\\nOn June 18, 2025, a SpaceX Starship rocket exploded during Dragon\\'s Flight: SpaceX Crew-10\\nlaunches aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9\\n\\na static fire test at the company’s Starbase facility in Texas, rocket carrying the Dragon spacecraft\\nfollowing what the company described as a “major piloted by astronaut and Air Force Maj.\\nanomaly”.[127]\\n\\nNichole \"Vapor\" Ayer at Kennedy Space\\nCenter, FL, March 14, 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nCrewed launches\\nA significant milestone was achieved in May 2020, when\\nSpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Doug\\nHurley and Bob Behnken) into orbit on a Crew Dragon\\nspacecraft during Crew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX the\\nfirst private company to send astronauts to the International\\nSpace Station and marking the first crewed orbital launch\\nfrom American soil in 9 years.[128][129] The mission launched\\nfrom Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A)\\nin Florida.[130]\\n\\nNASA astronauts Douglas Hurley (left)\\nand Robert Behnken (right) wearing\\n\\nStarlink custom-fit spacesuits designed by\\nSpaceX.\\n\\nIn May 2019, SpaceX launched the first large batch of 60\\nStarlink satellites, beginning to deploy what would become\\nthe world\\'s largest commercial satellite constellation the following year.[131] In 2022, most SpaceX\\nlaunches focused on Starlink, a consumer internet business that sends batches of internet-beaming\\nsatellites and now has over 6,000 satellites in orbit.[132]\\n\\nOn July 16, 2021, SpaceX entered an agreement to acquire Swarm Technologies, a private company\\nbuilding a low Earth orbit satellite constellation for communications with Internet of things (IoT) devices,\\nfor $524\\xa0million.[133][134]\\n\\nIn December 2022, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the launch of up to\\n7,500 of SpaceX\\'s next-generation satellites in its Starlink internet network.[135]\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary of achievements\\n\\nDate Achievement Flight\\n\\nFirst privately funded, fully liquid-fueled rocket to reach\\nSeptember 28, 2008\\n\\norbit.[136] Falcon 1 Flight 4\\n\\nJuly 14, 2009 First privately funded, fully liquid-fueled rocket to put a\\ncommercial satellite in orbit.

The Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket successfully reached orbit on its first\\nattempt on June 4, 2010. Its third flight, COTS Demo Flight 2, launched on May 22, 2012, and launched\\nthe first commercial spacecraft to reach and dock with the International Space Station (ISS).[46] The\\nvehicle was upgraded to Falcon 9 v1.1 in 2013, Falcon 9 Full Thrust in 2015, and finally to Falcon 9\\nBlock 5 in 2018. The first stage of Falcon 9 is designed to retro propulsively land, be recovered, and\\nflown again.[157]\\n\\nFalcon Heavy is a heavy-lift launch vehicle capable of delivering up to 63,800\\xa0kg (140,700\\xa0lb) to Low\\nEarth orbit (LEO) or 26,700\\xa0kg (58,900\\xa0lb) to geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). It uses three slightly\\nmodified Falcon 9 first-stage cores with a total of 27 Merlin 1D engines.[158][159] The Falcon Heavy\\nsuccessfully flew its inaugural mission on February 6, 2018, launching Musk\\'s personal Tesla Roadster\\ninto heliocentric orbit.[160]\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are certified to conduct launches for the National Security Space\\nLaunch (NSSL).[161][162] As of August 22, 2025, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy have been launched 529\\ntimes, resulting in 526 full mission successes, one partial success, and one in-flight failure. In addition, a\\nFalcon 9 experienced a pre-flight failure before a static fire test in 2016.[163][164]\\n\\nSpaceX is developing a fully reusable super-heavy lift launch system known as Starship. It comprises a\\nreusable first stage, called Super Heavy, and the reusable Starship second stage space vehicle. As of 2017,\\nthe system was intended to supersede the company\\'s existing launch vehicle hardware by the early\\n2020s.[165][166]\\n\\nRocket engines\\nSince the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company\\nhas developed several rocket engines\\xa0 – Merlin,\\nKestrel, and Raptor\\xa0 – for use in launch\\nvehicles,[167][168] Draco for the reaction control\\nsystem of the Dragon series of spacecraft,[169] and\\nSuperDraco for abort capability in Crew Dragon.[170]\\n\\nMerlin is a family of rocket engines that uses liquid\\noxygen (LOX) and RP-1 propellants. Merlin was first\\nused to power the Falcon 1\\'s first stage and is now\\nused on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy Merlin 1D engine undergoes a test at SpaceX\\'s\\nvehicles.[171] Kestrel uses the same propellants and Rocket Development and Test Facility in\\n\\nwas used as the Falcon 1 rocket\\'s second-stage main McGregor, Texas\\n\\nengine.[168][172]\\n\\nDraco and SuperDraco are hypergolic liquid-propellant rocket engines. Draco engines are used on the\\nreaction control system of the Dragon and Dragon 2 spacecraft.[169] The SuperDraco engine is more\\npowerful, and eight SuperDraco engines provide launch escape capability for crewed Dragon 2 spacecraft\\nduring an abort scenario.[173]\\n\\nRaptor is a new family of liquid oxygen and liquid methane-fueled full-flow staged combustion cycle\\nengines to power the first and second stages of the in-development Starship launch system.[167]\\n\\nDevelopment versions were test-fired in late 2016,[174] and the engine flew for the first time in 2019,\\npowering the Starhopper vehicle to an altitude of 20\\xa0m (66\\xa0ft).[175]\\n\\nDragon spacecraft\\nSpaceX has developed the Dragon spacecraft to transport cargo and crew to the International Space\\nStation (ISS).\\n\\nThe first-generation Dragon 1 spacecraft was used only for cargo operations. It was developed with\\nfinancial support from NASA under the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program.\\nAfter a successful COTS demonstration flight in 2010, SpaceX was chosen to receive a Commercial\\nResupply Services (CRS) contract.[39]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe currently operational second-generation Dragon 2\\nspacecraft conducted its first flight, without crew, to the ISS\\nin early 2019, followed by a crewed flight of Dragon 2 in\\n2020.[128] It was developed with financial support from\\nNASA under the Commercial Crew Program program. The\\ncargo variant of Dragon 2 flew for the first time in December\\n2020, for a resupply to the ISS as part of the CRS contract\\nwith NASA.[176]\\n\\nIn March 2020 SpaceX revealed the Dragon XL, designed as SpaceX Dragon 2 spacecraft, designed\\n\\na resupply spacecraft for NASA\\'s planned Lunar Gateway to deliver crew and cargo to and from the\\nInternational Space Station (cargo\\n\\nspace station under a Gateway Logistics Services (GLS) version shown)\\ncontract.[177] Dragon XL is planned to launch on the Falcon\\nHeavy, and is able to transport over 5,000\\xa0kg (11,000\\xa0 lb) to\\nthe Gateway. Dragon XL will be docked at the Gateway for six to twelve months at a time.[178]\\n\\nSpaceX designed a spacesuit to be worn inside the Dragon spacecraft to protect from possible\\ndepressurization.[179] On May 4, 2024, SpaceX unveiled a second spacesuit designed for extravehicular\\nactivity, planned to be used for a spacewalk during the Polaris Dawn mission.[180]\\n\\nAutonomous spaceport drone ships\\nSpaceX routinely returns the first stage of Falcon 9\\nand Falcon Heavy rockets after orbital launches. The\\nrocket lands at a predetermined landing site using\\nonly its propulsion systems.[181] When propellant\\nmargins do not permit a return to a launch site\\n(RTLS), rockets return to a floating landing platform\\nin the ocean, called autonomous spaceport drone ships\\n(ASDS).[182]\\n\\nSpaceX also had plans to introduce floating launch\\nplatforms, which would be modified oil rigs provide a\\nsea launch option for their Starship launch vehicle. As Autonomous spaceport drone ship in position\\n\\nof February 2023, SpaceX had sold the oil rigs, but prior to CRS-6 mission\\n\\nhad not ruled out sea-based platforms for future\\nuse.[183]\\n\\nStarlink\\nStarlink is an internet satellite constellation under development by Starlink Services, LLC, a wholly\\nowned subsidiary of SpaceX,[9][184] that consists of thousands of cross-linked communications satellites\\nin ~550\\xa0km orbits. Its goal is to address the significant unmet demand worldwide for low-cost broadband\\ncapabilities.[185] Development began in 2015, and initial prototype test-flight satellites were launched on\\nthe SpaceX Paz satellite mission in 2017. In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites\\naboard a Falcon 9.[186] Initial test operation of the constellation began in late 2020[187] and first orders\\n\\n\\n\\nwere taken in early 2021.[188] Customers were told to\\nexpect internet service speeds of 50\\xa0 Mbit/s to\\n150\\xa0Mbit/s and latency from 20 ms to 40 ms.[189] In\\nDecember 2022, Starlink reached over 1 million\\nsubscribers worldwide.[190]\\n\\nThe planned large number of Starlink satellites has\\nbeen criticized by astronomers due to concerns over\\nlight pollution,[191][192][193] with the brightness of\\nStarlink satellites in both optical and radio Sixty Starlink satellites stacked together before\\n\\nwavelengths interfering with scientific deployment\\n\\nobservations.[194] In response, SpaceX has\\nimplemented several upgrades to Starlink satellites aimed at reducing their brightness.[195] The large\\nnumber of satellites employed by Starlink also creates long-term dangers of space debris\\ncollisions.[196][197] However, the satellites are equipped with krypton-fueled Hall thrusters which allow\\nthem to de-orbit at the end of their life. They are also designed to autonomously avoid collisions based on\\nuplinked tracking data.[198]\\n\\nIn December 2022, SpaceX announced Starshield, a program to incorporate military or government entity\\npayloads on board a Starlink-derived satellite bus. The Space Development Agency is a key customer\\nprocuring satellites for a space-based missile defense system.[199][200]\\n\\nIn June 2024, SpaceX introduced a compact version of its Starlink antennas, the \"Starlink Mini\",\\ndesigned for mobile satellite internet use. Offered for $599 in an early access release, it was more\\nexpensive than the base model. The Mini antenna, half the size and one-third the weight of the Standard\\nversion, featured a built-in WiFi router, lower power consumption, and over 100 Mbit/s download\\nspeeds.[201]\\n\\nOther projects\\n\\nHyperloop\\nIn June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would sponsor a Hyperloop competition, and would build a\\n1.6\\xa0km (0.99\\xa0mi) long subscale test track near SpaceX\\'s headquarters for the competitive events.[202][203]\\n\\nThe company held the annual competition from 2017 to 2019.[204]\\n\\nCOVID-19 antibody-testing program\\nIn collaboration with doctors and academic researchers, SpaceX invited all employees to participate in\\nthe creation of a COVID-19 antibody-testing program in 2020. As such, 4300 employees volunteered to\\nprovide blood samples resulting in a peer-reviewed scientific paper crediting eight SpaceX employees as\\ncoauthors and suggesting that a certain level of COVID-19 antibodies may provide lasting protection\\nagainst the virus.[205][206]\\n\\n\\n\\nOther\\nIn July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children\\nstuck in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[207] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team,\\nencouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened.\\nHowever, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk\\'s\\ninvolvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\".[208][209] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company\\nbuilt the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally\\ndelivered it to Thailand.[210][211] Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it\\nwasn\\'t practical for the rescue mission.[207]\\n\\nFacilities\\nSpaceX is headquartered at the SpaceX Starbase near Brownsville, Texas, where it manufactures and\\nlaunches its Starship vehicle.

With approximately thirty missions on the\\nmanifest for 2018 alone, SpaceX represented over $12\\xa0billion under contract.[70]\\n\\nCargo to ISS\\nIn 2006, SpaceX won a NASA Commercial Orbital\\nTransportation Services (COTS) Phase 1 contract to\\ndemonstrate cargo delivery to the ISS, with a possible\\ncontract option for crew transport.[252] Through this contract,\\ndesigned by NASA to provide \"seed money\" through Space\\nAct Agreements for developing new capabilities, NASA paid\\nSpaceX $396\\xa0 million to develop the cargo configuration of\\nthe Dragon spacecraft, while SpaceX developed the Falcon 9\\nlaunch vehicle with their resources.[253] These Space Act\\nAgreements have been shown to have saved NASA millions\\nof dollars in development costs, making rocket development The COTS 2 Dragon is berthed to the\\n4–10 times less expensive than if produced by NASA International Space Station (ISS) by\\nalone.[254] Canadarm2\\n\\n\\n\\nIn December 2010, with the launch of the SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 1 mission, SpaceX became the\\nfirst private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft.[255] Dragon successfully\\nberthed with the ISS during SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 2 in May 2012, a first for a private\\nspacecraft.[256]\\n\\nCommercial Resupply Services (CRS) is a series of contracts awarded by NASA from 2008 to 2016 for\\nthe delivery of cargo and supplies to the ISS on commercially operated spacecraft. The first CRS\\ncontracts were signed in 2008 and awarded $1.6\\xa0 billion to SpaceX for 12 cargo transport missions,\\ncovering deliveries to 2016.[257] SpaceX CRS-1, the first of the 12 planned resupply missions, launched\\nin October 2012, achieved orbit, berthed, and remained on station for 20 days, before re-entering the\\natmosphere and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.[258]\\n\\nCRS missions have flown approximately twice a year to the ISS since then. In 2015, NASA extended the\\nPhase 1 contracts by ordering an additional three resupply flights from SpaceX, and then extended the\\ncontract further for a total of twenty cargo missions to the ISS.[259][257][260] The final Dragon 1 mission,\\nSpaceX CRS-20, departed the ISS in April 2020, and Dragon was subsequently retired from service. A\\nsecond phase of contracts was awarded in January 2016 with SpaceX as one of the awardees. SpaceX will\\nfly up to nine additional CRS flights with the upgraded Dragon 2 spacecraft.[261][262] In March 2020,\\nNASA contracted SpaceX to develop the Dragon XL spacecraft to send supplies to the Lunar Gateway\\nspace station. Dragon XL will be launched on a Falcon Heavy.[263]\\n\\nCrewed\\nSpaceX is responsible for the transportation of NASA\\nastronauts to and from the ISS. The NASA contracts\\nstarted as part of the Commercial Crew Development\\n(CCDev) program, aimed at developing commercially\\noperated spacecraft capable of delivering astronauts to\\nthe ISS. The first contract was awarded to SpaceX in\\n2011,[264][265] followed by another in 2012 to\\ncontinue development and testing of its Dragon 2\\nspacecraft.[266]\\n\\nIn September 2014, NASA chose SpaceX and Boeing NASA astronauts inside the Dragon spacecraft\\nas the two companies that would be funded to develop during the Crew-1 mission rendezvous with the\\nsystems to transport U.S. crews to and from the International Space Station\\n\\nISS.[267] SpaceX won $2.6\\xa0 billion to complete and\\ncertify Dragon 2 by 2017. The contracts called for at least one crewed flight test with at least one NASA\\nastronaut aboard. Once Crew Dragon received NASA human-spaceflight certification, the contract\\nrequired SpaceX to conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station.[267]\\n\\nSpaceX completed the first key flight test of its Crew Dragon spacecraft, a Pad Abort Test, in May\\n2015,[268] and successfully conducted a full uncrewed test flight in early 2019. The capsule docked to the\\nISS and then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean.[269] In January 2020, SpaceX conducted an in-flight\\nabort test, the last test flight before flying crew, in which the Dragon spacecraft fired its launch escape\\nengines in a simulated abort scenario.[270]\\n\\n\\n\\nOn May 30, 2020, the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission was launched to the International Space Station\\nwith NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, the first time a crewed vehicle had launched from\\nthe U.S. since 2011, and the first SpaceX commercial crewed launch to the ISS.[271] The Crew-1 mission\\nwas successfully launched to the International Space Station on November 16, 2020, with NASA\\nastronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker along with JAXA astronaut Soichi\\nNoguchi,[272] all members of the Expedition 64 crew.[273] On April 23, 2021, Crew-2 was launched to the\\nInternational Space Station with NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and K. Megan McArthur, JAXA\\nastronaut Akihiko Hoshide, and ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet.[274] The Crew-2 mission successfully\\ndocked on April 24, 2021.[275]\\n\\nSpaceX also offers paid crewed spaceflights for\\nprivate individuals. The first of these missions,\\nInspiration4, launched in 2021 on behalf of Shift4\\nPayments CEO Jared Isaacman. The mission launched\\nthe Crew Dragon Resilience from the Florida\\nKennedy Space Center\\'s Launch Complex 39A atop a\\nFalcon 9 launch vehicle, placed the Dragon capsule\\ninto low Earth orbit, and ended successfully about\\nthree days later when the Resilience splashed down in\\nthe Atlantic Ocean. All four crew members received Resilience after splashdown\\ncommercial astronaut training from SpaceX. The\\ntraining included lessons in orbital mechanics,\\noperating in a microgravity environment, stress testing, emergency-preparedness training, and mission\\nsimulations.[276]\\n\\nNational defense\\nIn 2005, SpaceX announced that it had been awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)\\ncontract, allowing the United States Air Force to purchase up to $100\\xa0million worth of launches from the\\ncompany.[277] Three years later, NASA announced that it had awarded an IDIQ Launch Services contract\\nto SpaceX for up to $1\\xa0billion, depending on the number of missions awarded.[278] In December 2012,\\nSpaceX announced its first two launch contracts with the United States Department of Defense (DoD).\\nThe United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center awarded SpaceX two EELV-class\\nmissions: Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and Space Test Program 2 (STP-2). DSCOVR\\nwas launched on a Falcon 9 launch vehicle in 2015, while STP-2 was launched on a Falcon Heavy on\\nJune 25, 2019.[279]\\n\\nThe Falcon 9 v1.1 was certified for National Security Space Launch (NSSL) in 2015, allowing SpaceX to\\ncontract launch services to the Air Force for any payloads classified under national security.[161] This\\nbroke the monopoly held since 2006 by United Launch Alliance (ULA) over U.S. Air Force launches of\\nclassified payloads.[280] In April 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded the first such national security launch\\nto SpaceX to launch the second GPS III satellite for $82.7\\xa0million.[281] This was approximately 40% less\\nthan the estimated cost for similar previous missions.[282] SpaceX also launched the third GPS III launch\\non June 20, 2020.[283] In March 2018, SpaceX secured an additional $290\\xa0million contract from the U.S.\\nAir Force to launch another three GPS III satellites.[284]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) also\\npurchased launches from SpaceX, with the first taking\\nplace on May 1, 2017.[285] In February 2019, SpaceX\\nsecured a $297\\xa0 million contract from the U.S. Air\\nForce to launch another three national security\\nmissions, all slated to launch no earlier than FY\\n2021.[286] In August 2020, the U.S. Space Force\\nawarded its National Security Space Launch (NSSL)\\ncontracts for the following 5–7 years. SpaceX won a\\ncontract for $316\\xa0million for one launch. In addition,\\nSpaceX will handle 40% of the U.S. military\\'s\\nsatellite launch requirements over the period.[287]\\n\\nSpaceX also designs and launches custom military\\nsatellites for the Space Development Agency as part\\nof a new missile defense system in low Earth\\norbit.[288] The constellation would give the United\\nStates capabilities to sense, target and potentially\\nintercept nuclear missiles and hypersonic weapons\\nlaunched from anywhere on Earth.[289] Both China\\nand Russia brought concerns to the United Nations\\nabout the program,[290] and various organizations\\nwarn it could be destabilizing and trigger an arms race Launch of the STP-2 mission on a Falcon Heavy\\n\\nin space.[291][292] in June 2019\\n\\nIn March 2024, Reuters reported that, as part of a\\n$1.8 billion contract signed with the National Reconnaissance Office in 2021, SpaceX is building a\\nnetwork of hundreds of spy satellites. This new network, Reuters reported, would be able to operate as a\\nswarm in low orbits.[293]\\n\\nIn December 2024, WSJ reported that Musk didn\\'t have access to government secrets.[294]\\n\\nLaunch market competition and pricing pressure\\nSpaceX\\'s low launch prices, especially for communications satellites flying to geostationary transfer orbit\\n(GTO), have resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their own prices.[19] Prior to 2013,\\nthe openly competed comsat launch market had been dominated by Arianespace (flying the Ariane 5) and\\nInternational Launch Services (flying the Proton).[295] With a published price of $56.5\\xa0million per launch\\nto low Earth orbit, Falcon 9 rockets were the least expensive in the industry.[296] European satellite\\noperators are pushing the ESA to reduce launch prices of the Ariane 5 and Ariane 6 rockets as a result of\\ncompetition from SpaceX.[297]\\n\\nSpaceX ended the United Launch Alliance (ULA) monopoly of U.S. military payloads when it began to\\ncompete for national security launches. In 2015, anticipating a slump in domestic, military, and spy\\nlaunches, ULA stated that it would go out of business unless it won commercial satellite launch\\n\\n\\n\\norders.[298] To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease\\nlaunch costs by half.[299][300]\\n\\nCongressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggested that the NASA Space Act Agreement process of\\n\"setting only a high-level requirement for cargo transport to the space station [while] leaving the details to\\nindustry\" had allowed SpaceX to design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at a substantially\\nlower cost. According to NASA\\'s own independently verified numbers, SpaceX\\'s total development cost\\nfor the Falcon 9 rocket, including the Falcon 1 rocket, was estimated at $390\\xa0million. In 2011, NASA\\nestimated that it would have cost the agency about $4\\xa0billion to develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster\\nbased upon NASA\\'s traditional contracting processes, about ten times more.[254] In May 2020, NASA\\nadministrator Jim Bridenstine remarked that thanks to NASA\\'s investments into SpaceX, the United\\nStates has 70% of the commercial launch market, a major improvement since 2012 when there were no\\ncommercial launches from the country.[301]\\n\\nAs of 2024, SpaceX operates a Rideshare and Bandwagon (mid inclination) programs. This provides\\nadditional competition for small satellite launchers.[302]\\n\\n\\n\\nCorporate affairs\\n\\nBusiness trends\\n\\nYear Revenue Valuation\\n(billion USD) (billion USD) Number of employees\\n\\n2002 ca. 30[303]\\n\\n2003\\n\\n2004\\n\\n2005 ca. 90 (Feb.)[304]\\n\\nca. 160 (Nov.)[305]\\n\\n2006\\n\\n2007 ca. 350 (Aug.)[306]\\n\\n2008 ca. 600 (Dec.)[307]\\n\\n2009 > 800 (Dec.)[308]\\n\\n2010 > 1,000 (June)[309]\\n\\n2011 ca. 1,300 (Jan.)[310]\\n\\n2012 2.4 (June)[311] ca. 1,800 (May)[312]\\n\\n2013 ca. 3,800 (Oct.)[313]\\n\\n2014 10 (Aug.)[314]\\n\\n2015 12 (Jan.)[315]\\n\\n2016 15 (Nov.)[316] ca. 5,000 (Nov.)[317]\\n\\n2017 21 (Nov.)[318] ca. 7,000 (Nov.)[319]\\n\\n2018 27 (Apr.)[320]\\n\\n2019 33 (May)[321] > 6,000 (July)[322]\\n\\n2020 1.8[323] 46 (Aug.)[324]\\n\\n2021 2.3[323] 74 (Feb.)[324]\\n\\n100 (Oct.)[324] > 9,500 (March)[325]\\n\\n2022 4.6[326] 127 (Aug.)[327] ca.\\xa012,000\\xa0(April)[328]\\n\\n2023 \\xa09[329] 137\\xa0(Jan.)[330]\\n\\n180\\xa0(Dec.)[331] >\\xa013,000\\xa0(Sept.)[332]\\n\\n2024 \\xa013.1[4] 350 (Dec.)[324] \\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n2025 ca.\\xa015.5[333] ca.\\xa0400\\xa0(July)[334] \\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBoard of directors\\n\\nSpaceX board of directors as of January 2021[335]\\n\\nJoined\\nboard Name Titles\\n\\n2002[336] Founder, chairman, CEO and CTO of SpaceX; CEO, Product Architect, and\\nElon Musk\\n\\nformer chairman of Tesla; former chairman of SolarCity[336]\\n\\n2002[337] Kimbal Musk Board member, Tesla[338]\\n\\nGwynne\\nShotwell President and COO of SpaceX[340]\\n\\n2009[339] Luke Nosek Co-founder, PayPal[341]\\n\\nSteve\\nJurvetson Co-founder, Future Ventures fund[342]\\n\\n2010[343] Antonio\\nGracias CEO and Chairman of the Investment Committee at Valor Equity Partners[344]\\n\\n2015[345] Donald\\nHarrison President of global partnerships and corporate development, Google[346]\\n\\nLeadership changes\\nIn November 2022, the company announced COO Gwynne Shotwell and vice president Mark Juncosa\\nwould oversee Starbase, its Texas launch facility, along with Omead Afshar, who at the time oversaw\\noperations for Tesla in Texas. Shyamal Patel, who was senior director of operations at the site, would shift\\nto its Cape Canaveral site. CNBC reported that these executive moves demonstrated \"the sense of urgency\\nwithin the company to get Starship flying\".[347][348][349]\\n\\nWorkplace culture\\n\\nAccording to former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver, the company overall has a male-dominated\\nemployee culture, similar to that of the spaceflight industry in general.[350] In December 2021, claims of\\nworkplace sexual harassment from five former SpaceX employees, ranging from interns to full engineers,\\nwere published.[351] The former employees claimed to have experienced unwanted advances and\\nuncomfortable interactions.[352] Additionally, the accounts included claims of a culture of sexual\\nharassment existing at the company and one where complaints made to executives, managers, and human\\nresources officers went largely unaddressed.[353]\\n\\nIn May 2022, a Business Insider article alleged that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct with a SpaceX\\nflight attendant in a private jet in 2016 citing an anonymous friend of the flight attendant.[354] In\\nresponse, some employees collaborated on an open letter condemning \"Elon\\'s harmful Twitter\\nbehavior\".[355] It also asks the company to clearly define SpaceX\\'s \"no-asshole\" and \"zero tolerance\"\\npolicies, which it says is unequally enforced from one employee to the next. The next day, Gwynne\\nShotwell announced that those employees who were involved with the letter had been terminated and\\nclaimed that unsponsored, unsolicited surveys were sent to employees during the work day and that some\\nfelt pressured to sign the letter.[356]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe company has also been described as having a work culture that pushes employees to work\\nexcessively and is described as fostering a burnout culture.[357] According to a memo by Blue Origin, a\\nrival aerospace company with a history of lawsuits and anti-SpaceX political lobbying,[358][359][360]\\n\\nSpaceX expected very long work hours, work on weekends, and limited use of holidays.[357]\\n\\n\"SpaceX employees say they’re paying the price for the billionaire’s push to colonize space at breakneck\\nspeed\" reported Reuters in 2023. An examination of OSHA\\'s records revealed injury rates higher than the\\nindustry\\'s averages. In addition, Reuters documented at least 600 previously unreported workplace\\ninjuries at SpaceX, including \"crushed limbs, amputations, electrocutions, head and eye wounds and one\\ndeath.\"[361] [362] The person who died was Lonnie LeBlanc, a former United States Marine.\\n\\nIn June 2024, eight ex-employees, the same who had previously been fired for penning the open letter\\nagainst Elon Musk, filed a lawsuit against Musk and SpaceX alleging sexual harassment and\\ndiscrimination.[363][364][365] The lawsuit has since stalled on headquarter jurisdiction grounds. [366][367]\\n\\nFederal investigations\\nIn August 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit against SpaceX for discriminating\\nagainst refugees and asylum seekers in its hiring process, alleging that the company violated the\\nImmigration and Nationality Act by rejecting refugees and asylum recipients and hiring only U.S. citizens\\nand permanent residents.[368] SpaceX denied wrongdoing, citing U.S. export control law.[369] In February\\n2025, the DOJ filed a motion to dismiss the case with prejudice.[369][370]\\n\\nIn December 2024, federal agencies investigated SpaceX for security violations as well as Musk\\'s alleged\\ndrug use.[371][372]\\n\\nEnvironmental impact\\nAccording to an investigation conducted by NPR, \"SpaceX has sometimes ignored environmental\\nregulations as it rushed to fulfill its founder’s vision. With each of its launches, records show, the\\ncompany discharged tens of thousands of gallons of what regulators classify as industrial wastewater into\\nthe surrounding environment.\"[373] In addition to endangering nearby people, the wastewater poses\\nsignificant threats to wildlife.[374]\\n\\nThe 2025 SpaceX Starship Flight 7 rocket explosion sent debris into the atmosphere that was spread\\nacross the Caribbean Sea. The incident also \"released significant amounts of harmful air pollution into the\\nupper layers of Earth\\'s atmosphere.\"[375]\\n\\nReferences\\n1. \"Delaware Business Search (File # 3500808\\xa0– Space Exploration Technologies Corp)\" (http\\n\\ns://icis.corp.delaware.gov/eCorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx).

Video games\\nwas our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets\\nfunding huge R&D to solve massive computational\\nproblems.\"[29]\\n\\nNvidia\\'s former headquarters which was\\nThe first problem was who would quit first. Huang\\'s wife, home to the company through most of its\\nLori, did not want him to resign from LSI unless pre-AI period (still in use)\\nMalachowsky resigned from Sun at the same time, and\\nMalachowsky\\'s wife, Melody, felt the same way about\\n\\n\\n\\nHuang.[30] Priem broke that deadlock by resigning first from\\nSun, effective December 31, 1992.[30] According to Priem,\\nthis put pressure on Huang and Malachowsky to not leave\\nhim to \"flail alone\", so they gave notice too.[31] Huang left\\nLSI and \"officially joined Priem on February 17\", which was\\nalso Huang\\'s 30th birthday, while Malachowsky left Sun in\\nearly March.[31] In early 1993, the three founders began\\nworking together on their new startup in Priem\\'s townhouse\\nin Fremont, California.[32]\\n\\nWith $40,000 in the bank, the company was born.[29] The\\ncompany subsequently received $20 million of venture capital\\nfunding from Sequoia Capital, Sutter Hill Ventures and\\nothers.[33]\\n\\nDuring the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 startup\\ncompanies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for Aerial view of Endeavor, the first of the\\n\\ntwo new Nvidia headquarters buildings, in\\nvideo games was the path to the future.[25] Only two Santa Clara, California, in 2017\\nsurvived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which\\nmerged into AMD.[25]\\n\\nNvidia initially had no name.[34] Priem\\'s first idea was\\n\"Primal Graphics\", a syllabic abbreviation of two of the\\nfounders\\' last names, but that left out Huang.[34] They soon\\ndiscovered it was impossible to create a workable name with\\nsyllables from all three founders\\' names, after considering\\n\"Huaprimal\", \"Prihuamal\", \"Malluapri\", etc.[34] The next idea\\ncame from Priem\\'s idea for the name of Nvidia\\'s first\\nproduct.[34] Priem originally wanted to call it the \"GXNV\", as Entrance of Endeavor headquarters\\n\\nbuilding in 2018\\nin the \"next version\" of the GX graphics chips which he had\\nworked on at Sun.[32] Then Huang told Priem to \"drop the\\nGX\", resulting in the name \"NV\".[32] Priem made a list of words with the letters \"NV\" in them.[34] At one\\npoint, Malachowsky and Priem wanted to call the company NVision, but that name was already taken by\\na manufacturer of toilet paper.[26] Both Priem[34] and Huang have taken credit for coming up with the\\nname Nvidia,[26] from \"invidia\", the Latin word for \"envy\".[29]\\n\\nAfter the company outgrew Priem\\'s townhouse, its original headquarters office was in Sunnyvale,\\nCalifornia.[29]\\n\\nFirst graphics accelerator\\nNvidia\\'s first graphics accelerator, the NV1, was designed to process quadrilateral primitives (forward\\ntexture mapping), a feature that set it apart from competitors, who preferred triangle primitives.[26]\\n\\nHowever, when Microsoft introduced the DirectX platform, it chose not to support any other graphics\\nsoftware and announced that its Direct3D API would exclusively support triangles.[26][35] As a result, the\\nNV1 failed to gain traction in the market.[36]\\n\\n\\n\\nNvidia had also entered into a partnership with Sega to supply the graphics chip for the Dreamcast\\nconsole and worked on the project for about a year. However, Nvidia\\'s technology was already lagging\\nbehind competitors. This placed the company in a difficult position: continue working on a chip that was\\nlikely doomed to fail or abandon the project, risking financial collapse.[37]\\n\\nIn a pivotal moment, Sega\\'s president, Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that\\nSega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia\\'s\\npotential and persuaded Sega\\'s management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected\\nthat this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri\\'s \"understanding and generosity gave us\\nsix months to live\".[37]\\n\\nIn 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia\\'s employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to\\n40—and focused the company\\'s remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product\\noptimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128.[26][35] By the time the RIVA 128 was\\nreleased in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month\\'s payroll.[26] The sense of\\nimpending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia\\'s unofficial company motto: \"Our\\ncompany is thirty days from going out of business.\"[26] Huang began internal presentations to Nvidia staff\\nwith those words for many years.[26]\\n\\nNvidia sold about a million RIVA 128 units within four months,[26] and used the revenue to fund\\ndevelopment of its next generation of products.[35] In 1998, the release of the RIVA TNT helped solidify\\nNvidia\\'s reputation as a leader in graphics technology.[38]\\n\\nPublic company\\nNvidia went public on January 22, 1999.[39][40][41] Investing in Nvidia after it had already failed to\\ndeliver on its contract turned out to be Irimajiri\\'s best decision as Sega\\'s president. After Irimajiri left\\nSega in 2000, Sega sold its Nvidia stock for $15 million.[37]\\n\\nIn late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU,\\nwhich was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level\\n3D hardware. Running at 120\\xa0MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video\\nacceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed\\nexisting products by a wide margin.\\n\\nDue to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for\\nMicrosoft\\'s Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project took\\nmany of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the\\nGeForce 2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000. In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to\\nacquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology\\nleading the field from the mid-1990s until 2000.[42][43] The acquisition process was finalized in April\\n2002.[44]\\n\\nIn 2001, Standard & Poor\\'s selected Nvidia to replace the departing Enron in the S&P 500 stock index,\\nmeaning that index funds would need to hold Nvidia shares going forward.[45]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software-rendering tools and\\nthe personnel were merged into the Cg project.[46] In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for\\napproximately US$70 million.[47] It launched GoForce the following year. On April 22, 2004, Nvidia\\nacquired iReady, also a provider of high-performance TCP offload engines and iSCSI controllers.[48] In\\nDecember 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics\\nprocessor (RSX) for the PlayStation 3 game console. On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI\\nElectronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia\\'s\\ncompetitor.[49] In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[50] In December 2006, Nvidia, along\\nwith its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the\\nU.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[51]\\n\\n2007–2014\\nForbes named Nvidia its Company of the Year for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the\\nsaid period as well as during the previous five years.[52] On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it\\nhad completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc.[53] In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia,\\ndeveloper of PhysX, a physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to\\nintegrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.[54][55]\\n\\nIn July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after\\nreporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had \"abnormal failure rates\"\\ndue to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008,\\nNvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had\\nbeen incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September\\n2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs\\nor, in some cases, replacement.[56][57] On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-\\nlicensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.[58]\\n\\nIn November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its ARM-based\\nsystem on a chip for mobile devices, Tegra 3. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-\\ncore mobile CPU.[59][60] In May 2011, it was announced that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Icera, a\\nbaseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million.[61] In January 2013, Nvidia unveiled the\\nTegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new\\nsystem on a chip.[62] On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from\\nSTMicroelectronics.[63]\\n\\nIn February 2013, Nvidia announced its plans to build a new headquarters in the form of two giant\\ntriangle-shaped buildings on the other side of San Tomas Expressway (to the west of its existing\\nheadquarters complex). The company selected triangles as its design theme. As Huang explained in a\\nblog post, the triangle is \"the fundamental building block of computer graphics\".[64]\\n\\nIn 2014, Nvidia ported the Valve games Portal and Half Life 2 to its Nvidia Shield Tablet as Lightspeed\\nStudio.[65][66] Since 2014, Nvidia has diversified its business focusing on three markets: gaming,\\nautomotive electronics, and mobile devices.[67]\\n\\nThat same year, Nvidia also prevailed in litigation brought by the trustee of 3dfx\\'s bankruptcy estate to\\nchallenge its 2000 acquisition of 3dfx\\'s intellectual assets. On November 6, 2014, in an unpublished\\nmemorandum order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the \"district court\\'s\\n\\n\\n\\njudgment affirming the bankruptcy court\\'s determination that [Nvidia] did not pay less than fair market\\nvalue for assets purchased from 3dfx shortly before 3dfx filed for bankruptcy\".[68]\\n\\n2016–2018\\nOn May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GPUs of the GeForce 10 series, the GTX 1080 and 1070,\\nbased on the company\\'s new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its\\nMaxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and\\nuse a 16\\xa0 nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as\\nsimultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and\\nvirtual reality (VR) rendering.[69][70][71] Laptops that include these GPUs and are sufficiently thin\\xa0– as of\\nlate 2017, under 0.8 inches (20\\xa0 mm)\\xa0 – have been designated as meeting Nvidia\\'s \"Max-Q\" design\\nstandard.[72]\\n\\nIn July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model,\\nas the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4\\xa0GB of VRAM due to limitations brought by the\\ndesign of its hardware.[73] In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota which would use\\nNvidia\\'s Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles.[74] In July 2017,\\nNvidia and Chinese search giant Baidu announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud\\ncomputing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu\\'s open-source AI framework\\nPaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that Nvidia\\'s Drive PX 2 AI will be the foundation of its autonomous-\\nvehicle platform.[75]\\n\\nNvidia officially released the Titan V on December 7, 2017.[76][77]\\n\\nNvidia officially released the Nvidia Quadro GV100 on March 27, 2018.[78] Nvidia officially released the\\nRTX 2080 GPUs on September 27, 2018. In 2018, Google announced that Nvidia\\'s Tesla P4 graphic\\ncards would be integrated into Google Cloud service\\'s artificial intelligence.[79]\\n\\nIn May 2018, on the Nvidia user forum, a thread was started[80] asking the company to update users when\\nthey would release web drivers for its cards installed on legacy Mac Pro machines up to mid-2012 5,1\\nrunning the macOS Mojave operating system 10.14. Web drivers are required to enable graphics\\nacceleration and multiple display monitor capabilities of the GPU. On its Mojave update info website,\\nApple stated that macOS Mojave would run on legacy machines with \\'Metal compatible\\' graphics\\ncards[81] and listed Metal compatible GPUs, including some manufactured by Nvidia.[82] However, this\\nlist did not include Metal compatible cards that currently work in macOS High Sierra using Nvidia-\\ndeveloped web drivers. In September, Nvidia responded, \"Apple fully controls drivers for macOS. But if\\nApple allows, our engineers are ready and eager to help Apple deliver great drivers for macOS 10.14\\n(Mojave).\"[83] In October, Nvidia followed this up with another public announcement, \"Apple fully\\ncontrols drivers for macOS. Unfortunately, Nvidia currently cannot release a driver unless it is approved\\nby Apple,\"[84] suggesting a possible rift between the two companies.[85] By January 2019, with still no\\nsign of the enabling web drivers, Apple Insider weighed into the controversy with a claim that Apple\\nmanagement \"doesn\\'t want Nvidia support in macOS\".[86] The following month, Apple Insider followed\\nthis up with another claim that Nvidia support was abandoned because of \"relational issues in the\\npast\",[87] and that Apple was developing its own GPU technology.[88] Without Apple-approved Nvidia\\nweb drivers, Apple users are faced with replacing their Nvidia cards with a competing supported brand,\\nsuch as AMD Radeon from the list recommended by Apple.[89]\\n\\n\\n\\n2019 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies\\nOn March 11, 2019, Nvidia announced a deal to buy\\nMellanox Technologies for $6.9 billion[90] to substantially\\nexpand its footprint in the high-performance computing\\nmarket. In May 2019, Nvidia announced new RTX Studio\\nlaptops. The creators say that the new laptop is going to be\\nseven times faster than a top-end MacBook Pro with a Core i9\\nand AMD\\'s Radeon Pro Vega 20 graphics in apps like Maya\\nand RedCine-X Pro.[91] In August 2019, Nvidia announced\\nMinecraft RTX, an official Nvidia-developed patch for the\\ngame Minecraft adding real-time DXR ray tracing exclusively Nvidia Yokneam office (former Mellanox\\nto the Windows 10 version of the game. The whole game is, Technologies) in Yokneam Illit, Israel, in\\nin Nvidia\\'s words, \"refit\" with path tracing, which March 2023\\ndramatically affects the way light, reflections, and shadows\\nwork inside the engine.[92]\\n\\n2020–2023\\nIn May 2020, Nvidia announced it was acquiring Cumulus Networks.[93] Post acquisition the company\\nwas absorbed into Nvidia\\'s networking business unit, along with Mellanox.\\n\\nIn May 2020, Nvidia\\'s developed an open-source ventilator to address the shortage resulting from the\\nglobal coronavirus pandemic.[94] On May 14, 2020, Nvidia officially announced their Ampere GPU\\nmicroarchitecture and the Nvidia A100 GPU accelerator.[95][96] In July 2020, it was reported that Nvidia\\nwas in talks with SoftBank to buy Arm, a UK-based chip designer, for $32 billion.[97]\\n\\nOn September 1, 2020, Nvidia officially announced the GeForce 30 series based on the company\\'s new\\nAmpere microarchitecture.[98][99]\\n\\nOn September 13, 2020, Nvidia announced that they would buy Arm from SoftBank Group for $40\\nbillion, subject to the usual scrutiny, with the latter retaining a 10% share of Nvidia.[100][101][102][103]\\n\\nIn October 2020, Nvidia announced its plan to build the most\\npowerful computer in Cambridge, England. The computer,\\ncalled Cambridge-1, launched in July 2021 with a $100\\nmillion investment and will employ AI to support healthcare\\nresearch.[104][105] According to Jensen Huang, \"The\\nCambridge-1 supercomputer will serve as a hub of innovation\\nfor the UK, and further the groundbreaking work being done\\nby the nation\\'s researchers in critical healthcare and drug Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, part of the\\ndiscovery.\"[106] RTX 20 series, which is the first\\n\\ngeneration of Nvidia RTX\\nAlso in October 2020, along with the release of the Nvidia\\nRTX A6000, Nvidia announced it is retiring its workstation\\nGPU brand Quadro, shifting its product name to Nvidia RTX for future products and the manufacturing\\nto be Nvidia Ampere architecture-based.[107]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn August 2021, the proposed takeover of Arm was stalled after the UK\\'s Competition and Markets\\nAuthority raised \"significant competition concerns\".[108] In October 2021, the European Commission\\nopened a competition investigation into the takeover. The Commission stated that Nvidia\\'s acquisition\\ncould restrict competitors\\' access to Arm\\'s products and provide Nvidia with too much internal\\ninformation on its competitors due to their deals with Arm. SoftBank (the parent company of Arm) and\\nNvidia announced in early February 2022 that they \"had agreed not to move forward with the transaction\\n\\'because of significant regulatory challenges\\' \".[109] The investigation was set to end on March 15,\\n2022.[110][111] That same month, Nvidia was reportedly compromised by a cyberattack.[112] This would\\nhave been the largest semiconductor acquisition in history.[17][18]\\n\\nIn March 2022, Nvidia\\'s CEO Jensen Huang mentioned that they were open to having Intel manufacture\\ntheir chips in the future.[113] This was the first time the company mentioned that they would work\\ntogether with Intel\\'s upcoming foundry services.\\n\\nIn April 2022, it was reported that Nvidia planned to open a new research center in Yerevan,\\nArmenia.[114]\\n\\nIn May 2022, Nvidia opened Voyager, the second of the two giant buildings at its new headquarters\\ncomplex to the west of the old one.

The conflict escalated when Amodei vehemently\\ndenied Huang\\'s allegations that he sought to control the AI industry through safety concerns, calling\\nHuang\\'s claims an \"outrageous lie.\"[256] The dispute centered on differing philosophies regarding AI\\n\\n\\n\\ndevelopment, with Amodei advocating for stronger regulatory oversight and \"responsible scaling\\npolicies,\" while Huang promoted open-source development and criticized what Nvidia characterized as\\n\"regulatory capture.\"[256] Nvidia responded by stating that \"lobbying for regulatory capture against open\\nsource will only stifle innovation, make AI less safe and secure, and less democratic.\"[256] The\\ncontroversy highlighted broader tensions within the AI industry between companies favoring rapid\\ndevelopment and those emphasizing safety measures and regulation.[256]\\n\\nProposed Shanghai facility\\nIn May 2025, U.S. senators Jim Banks and Elizabeth Warren criticized a proposed Nvidia facility in\\nShanghai, saying that it \"raises significant national security and economic security issues that warrant\\nserious review.\"[257]\\n\\nH20 production halt (2025)\\nIn August 2025, Nvidia ordered suppliers to halt production of its H20 AI chip following Chinese\\ngovernment directives warning domestic companies against purchasing the processor due to security\\nconcerns.[258][259] The company directed suppliers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\\nCompany, Samsung Electronics, and Amkor Technology to suspend work on the China-focused\\nprocessor.[260]\\n\\nThe H20 was developed in late 2023 specifically for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export\\nrestrictions, featuring 96GB of HBM3 memory and 4.0 TB/s memory bandwidth—higher than the H100\\n—but with significantly reduced computational power at 296 TFLOPs compared to the H100\\'s 1979\\nTFLOPs.[261][262] Despite lower raw performance, the H20 demonstrated over 20% faster performance\\nthan the H100 in large language model inference tasks due to architectural optimizations.[261][262]\\n\\nPrior to the production halt, Nvidia had placed substantial orders for the H20, including 300,000 units\\nfrom TSMC in July 2025, driven by strong demand from Chinese technology companies.[263] CEO\\nJensen Huang denied allegations that the H20 contained security backdoors, stating the chips were\\ndesigned solely for commercial use.[264] The production suspension occurred as Nvidia was developing\\nthe B30A, a new chip based on its Blackwell architecture intended to succeed the H20 in the Chinese\\nmarket.[265]\\n\\nSee also\\nSan Francisco Bay\\nArea portal\\nCompanies portal\\n\\nElectronics portal\\n\\nTechnology portal\\n\\nFast approximate anti-aliasing\\nGeneral-purpose computing on graphics processing units\\nHuang\\'s law\\n\\n\\n\\nMolecular modeling on GPUs\\nNvidia Parabricks - GPU-accelerated genomics toolkit\\nGPU workstations\\nGroq\\n\\nNotes\\n\\na.

In September that year, all Tesla cars started\\nshipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called \"hardware version 1\".[40]\\n\\nTesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business) battery\\npacks in April 2015.[41] The company received orders valued at $800\\xa0million within a week of the unveiling.[42]\\n\\nTesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at\\nthe time.[43][44]\\n\\nSolarCity and Model 3 (2016–2018)\\nTesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6\\xa0billion\\ndeal.[45] The business was merged with Tesla\\'s existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy\\nsubsidiary.[46] The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of\\nwhich Tesla\\'s shareholders were not informed.[47] In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better\\nreflect the scope of its expanded business.[48]\\n\\nTesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. The Model 3 was less expensive than Tesla\\'s\\nprevious three vehicles, and within a week, the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[49] To speed up\\nproduction and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3, but the robotics\\nactually slowed the production of the vehicles.[50] This led to significant delays and production problems, a period which\\nthe company described as \"production hell\".[51][52] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and\\nthe Model 3 became the world\\'s best-selling electric car from 2018 to 2021.[53][54]\\n\\nThis period of \"production hell\" put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most\\nshorted companies in the stock market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he\\nwas considering taking Tesla private.[55][56] The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many\\nlawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC, which would force Musk to pay a $20 million fine and step\\ndown as the company\\'s chairman, although he was allowed to remain the CEO.\\n\\nGlobal expansion and Model Y (2019–present)\\nFrom July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible\\nfor inclusion in the S&P 500.[57] During 2020, its share price increased 740%,[58] and by December 14, 2020, its market\\ncapitalization was more than the next nine largest automakers combined,[59] and it became the sixth most valuable\\n\\n\\n\\ncompany in the US.[60] Tesla was added to the S&P index on December 21, 2020;[61] it was the most valuable company\\never added, and was the sixth-largest member of the index immediately after it was added.[61][62]\\n\\nTesla introduced its second mass-market vehicle in March 2019, the Model Y mid-size crossover SUV, based on the Model\\n3.[63][64] Deliveries started in March 2020.[65]\\n\\nDuring this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick\\nsuccession. Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully\\nowned by a foreign company (not a joint venture).[66] The factory\\'s first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out in\\nDecember, less than one year after groundbreaking.[67] Gigafactory Berlin broke ground in February 2020,[68] and its\\nproduction of the Model Y began in March 2022.[69] Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June 2020,[70] and its production\\nof the Model Y began in April 2022.[71] In March 2023, Tesla announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in\\n2025,[72] but its groundbreaking has been delayed.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla closed the Fremont Factory in March 2020 due to California state and\\nAlameda county COVID restrictions.[73] When California lifted restrictions, but the county did not, Tesla sued the county,\\nand restarted production on May 11, 2020.[74] The county lifted restrictions on May 13, 2020, and Tesla dropped its\\nlawsuit.[75] After the dispute with county officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory\\nTexas.[76][77] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years\\nsignificantly expanded its footprint in California. The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in\\nLathrop, California in 2022,[78] and announced in February 2023 that it would establish a large global engineering\\nheadquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard.[79]\\n\\nIn early 2021, Tesla became a major investor in bitcoin, acquiring $1.5\\xa0billion of the cryptocurrency,[80] and on March 24,\\n2021, the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases.[81] However, after 49 days,\\nthe company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of\\nfossil fuels, against the company\\'s mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy.[82] After the announcement,\\nthe price of bitcoin dropped around 12%.[83] Tesla CEO Elon Musk later noted that Tesla would resume bitcoin payments\\nif there was confirmation of at least 50% clean energy usage by bitcoin miners. Despite later reaching this milestone, Tesla\\ndid not return to accepting bitcoin.[84] By July 2022 Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that\\nthe cryptocurrency was hurting the company\\'s profitability.[85]\\n\\nBetween May 2023 and February 2024, almost all major North America EV manufacturers announced plans to switch to\\nTesla\\'s North American Charging Standard adapters on their EVs by 2025, which is expected to be a stable source of\\nrecurring revenue for Tesla.[86] In November, Tesla started shipping the Cybertruck, produced from Gigafactory Texas.[87]\\n\\nIn April 2024, the company announced it was laying off 10% of its employees.[88] In June, the company moved its\\nincorporation from Delaware to Texas.[89] In October, the company unveiled a concept version of two autonomous\\nvehicles – the Cybercab and Robovan – and detailed that both would be an integral part of a Tesla ridehailing service\\ncalled the Tesla Network,[90][91] a future service they had previously teased in 2019.[92]\\n\\nIn December 2024, a Delaware court rejected Elon Musk\\'s $56 billion pay package from Tesla, ruling that it was not\\nproperly approved by the company\\'s board. The decision arose from a lawsuit by Tesla shareholders who claimed the\\ncompensation was excessive and not aligned with performance metrics.[93]\\n\\nBy February 2025, Tesla saw large decreases in its stock price and sales across Europe widely attributed to Elon Musk\\'s\\npolitical advocacy and embrace of far-right politics.[94] Polling found that Musk\\'s ties to United States President Donald\\nTrump and his Department of Government Efficiency were strongly correlated to decreasing views of Tesla,[95][96] and\\ntriggered multiple protests, vandalism, gunfire, and arson at Tesla stores and charging stations.[97][98] By March 7, Tesla\\'s\\nstock had decreased every week for seven straight weeks since Musk joined the Trump administration, making it the\\nlongest losing streak for Tesla in 15 years as a public company.[99] On March 29, over 200 protests against Tesla were held\\nworldwide.[100]\\n\\nIn July 2025, Tesla released a software update adding the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Grok to its vehicles. While the\\nupdate provides in-car chatbot functionality, it does not give Grok control over vehicle functions.[101] The same month,\\nTesla opened its first showroom in India at the Bandra-Kurla Complex in Mumbai, showcasing the Model Y as its debut\\n\\n\\n\\noffering.[102][103]\\n\\nAutomotive products and services\\nAs of November\\xa02024, Tesla offers six vehicle models: Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y, Semi, and Cybertruck.\\nTesla\\'s first vehicle, the first-generation Tesla Roadster, is no longer sold.

In July 2024, Musk said that the Roadster should enter\\nproduction in 2025.[120]\\n\\nTesla next-generation vehicle\\nThe Tesla next-generation vehicle is an announced battery electric platform. It\\nwould become the third platform for the company. Vehicles based on this Tesla Roadster prototype\\n\\nplatform are not expected before 2025.[121] In July 2024, Musk said that the\\nplatform should be expected to become available in the first half of 2025.[120]\\n\\nCybercab\\nThe Tesla Cybercab, also known as the Robotaxi, is an upcoming two-\\npassenger battery-electric self-driving car under development by Tesla.\\n\\nA concept version of the Cybercab was unveiled in October 2024, with 20\\nprototypes providing short rides to attendees of the announcement event.

The Roadster was\\nthe first highway-legal serial production electric car to use lithium-ion battery\\ncells, and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles\\n(320\\xa0km) per charge.\\n\\nThe original Roadster\\n\\nServices\\n\\nConnectivity services\\nTesla cars come with \"Standard Connectivity\", which provides navigation using a cellular connection. For a fee, Tesla\\noffers a subscription to \"Premium Connectivity\" which adds live traffic and satellite maps to navigation, internet browsing,\\nand media streaming.[125]\\n\\nVehicle servicing\\nTesla\\'s strategy is to service its vehicles first through remote diagnosis and repair. If it is not possible to resolve a problem\\nremotely, a mobile technician is dispatched or customers are referred to a local Tesla-owned service center.[126][127] As of\\nOctober\\xa02024, the company operates 1,306 retail stores, galleries, service, delivery and body shop locations globally.[128]\\n\\nTesla has said that it does not want to make a profit on vehicle servicing, which has traditionally been a large profit center\\nfor most auto dealerships.[129]\\n\\nIn 2016, Tesla recommended having any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In\\nearly 2019, the manual was changed to say: \"your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes,\"\\nand instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.[130]\\n\\nCharging services\\n\\nSupercharger network\\nSupercharger is the branding used by Tesla for its high-voltage direct current fast chargers.\\n\\nThe Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla\\nModel S entered production, with five stations in California. As of July\\xa02025,\\nTesla operates a network of about 7,500 Supercharger stations with over\\n70,000 connectors worldwide. The majority are located in three regions: Asia\\nPacific (3,000 stations), North America (3,000), and Europe (1,500).\\nSuperchargers can currently output as much as 325\\xa0kilowatts\\xa0(kW), with plans\\nto increase output capacity to 500 kW in the future.\\n\\nDestination charging location network\\nTesla also has a network of \"Destination Chargers\", slower than Superchargers Tesla Supercharger station in Wittenburg,\\nand intended for locations where customers are expected to park and stay for Germany\\n\\nseveral hours, such as hotels, restaurants, or shopping centers. Unlike the\\nSupercharger network, Tesla does not own the destination chargers, instead,\\n\\n\\n\\nproperty owners set up the devices and set pricing.[131] When the network first launched\\nin 2014, Tesla provided free charging equipment and covered installation costs. One of\\nthe largest providers is hotel chain Hilton Worldwide which in 2023 announced an\\nagreement with Tesla to install 20,000 chargers across 2,000 of its properties in North\\nAmerica by 2025.[132]\\n\\nInsurance services\\nTesla has offered its own vehicle insurance in the United States since 2017 and has been\\nacting as an independent insurance producer since 2021 as Tesla Insurance Services, Inc.\\nIt was introduced after the American Automobile Association (AAA), a major insurance\\ncarrier, raised rates for Tesla owners in June 2017 after a report concluded that the\\nautomakers vehicles crashed more often and were pricier to repair than comparable\\nvehicles.[133] A study in 2018 based on data from the Insurance Institute for Highway\\nSafety confirmed the findings.[134]\\n\\n\"Destination Charger\" in North\\nAmerica\\n\\nThe company says that it uniquely understands its vehicles, technology and repair costs,\\nand can eliminate traditional insurance carriers\\' additional charges.[135] In states where\\nallowed, the company uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing that can increase or decrease in cost based\\non the prior month\\'s driving safety score.[136]\\n\\nAs of January\\xa0 2023, Tesla offers insurance in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland,\\nMinnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia.[137] The company also offers insurance for non-Tesla\\nvehicles owned by Tesla owners.[135]\\n\\nEnergy products\\nTesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy\\ngeneration systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and\\nservices) to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was\\ncreated by the merger of Tesla\\'s existing battery energy storage products division with\\nSolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016.[138] In 2023, the\\ncompany deployed 14.7 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, an increase\\nof 125% over 2022, but only deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 223\\nmegawatts, a decrease of 36% over 2022.[139]\\n\\nTesla Energy products include solar panels (built by other companies for Tesla), the\\nTesla Solar Roof (a solar shingle system) and the Tesla Solar Inverter. Storage products Two Tesla Powerwall 2 home\\ninclude the Powerwall (a home energy storage device) and the Megapack (a large-scale energy storage devices from\\nenergy storage system).[140][141][142] Tesla Energy\\n\\nFor large-scale customers, Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for\\nautomated, real-time power trading, demand forecasting and product control.[143][144][145] In March 2021, the company\\nsaid its online products were managing over 1.2\\xa0GWh of storage.[146] For home customers, the company operates a virtual\\npower company in Texas called Tesla Electric, which utilizes the company\\'s online platforms to manage customers\\nPowerwall devices, discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high, earning money for\\ncustomers.[147][148]\\n\\nBusiness strategy\\nAt the time of Tesla\\'s founding in 2003, electric vehicles were costly.[149] In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla\\'s strategy\\nwas to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price.\\nThis would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper\\n\\n\\n\\nand higher volume cars.[17][150] Tesla\\'s first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-\\nvolume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The\\nnext models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury\\nvehicles. The Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a\\nhigher volume market,[151][152] selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter.\\nTesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a\\nnew model year, unlike nearly every other car manufacturer.[153]\\n\\nUnlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell\\nvehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a Robotic manufacturing of the Model S at\\nnetwork of company-owned stores.[154][155] The company is the first the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California\\n\\nautomaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers.[156][157]\\n\\nSome jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto\\nmanufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the\\ncompany says, \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of\\nvehicles.\"[158][159] In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries.[160] These locations\\nare typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas,[155] instead of near other\\nauto dealerships.[161][162][163]\\n\\nAnalysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in-house, such as batteries,\\nmotors, and software.[164] The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically\\noutsource 80% of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.[165][166][167]\\n\\nTesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the\\nworld\\'s use of sustainable energy.[168] Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file\\npatent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[169] Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as\\ntrademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.[170]\\n\\nOn April 15, 2024, Tesla secured a deal with Tata Electronics to supply semiconductor chips, marking a significant step in\\nTesla\\'s expansion into India\\'s automotive market.[171]\\n\\nOn May 2, 2024, Tesla announced that it has abandoned its plan for next-generation gigacasting, a cutting-edge\\nmanufacturing technique. Initially aiming to revolutionize production and reduce costs, Tesla has now opted for its more\\nproven method of casting vehicle underbodies in three pieces. This strategic shift reflects the company\\'s focus on self-\\ndriving vehicles and adjusting to market challenges.[172]\\n\\nTechnology\\nTesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[164]\\n\\nBatteries\\nAs of 2023, Tesla uses four different battery cell form factors: 18650, 2170,\\n4680, and prismatic.[173][174][175]\\n\\nTesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers, CATL, LG Energy\\nSolution, and Panasonic, the latter of which has co-located some of its battery\\nproduction inside Tesla\\'s Gigafactory Nevada. Tesla is also currently building\\nout the capacity to produce its own batteries.\\n\\nTesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space. Tesla uses a\\nmultipart aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from\\nroad debris or vehicle crashes.[176] Tesla vehicle chassis used in Model S\\n\\nand X, with the battery visible\\n\\n\\n\\nBusiness analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla\\'s battery pack cost\\nin 2021 at $112 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), versus an industry average of $132\\nper kWh.[177]\\n\\n18650\\nTesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical, lithium-ion battery cells. When\\nit built the first generation Roadster, it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18\\xa0mm\\ndiameter, 65\\xa0mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other\\nconsumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because Comparison of Tesla\\'s three cylindrical\\neach has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together battery cell form factors\\nin a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a\\nchallenge, requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention\\nchemical.[178] However, the decision turned out to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process\\nthat could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest\\ntechnology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum\\n(NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic\\'s factories in Japan.[173]\\n\\n2170\\nThe next battery type to be used was the 2170-type (21\\xa0mm diameter, 70\\xa0mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was\\noptimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170\\nwas introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles.[173]\\n\\nFor vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum\\ncathode chemistry from Panasonic\\'s production line at Gigafactory Nevada.[179] In January 2021, Panasonic had the\\ncapacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there.[180] Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home\\nenergy storage product.\\n\\nFor vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin batteries with a nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC)\\ncathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution\\'s factories in China.[173]\\n\\n4680\\nTesla\\'s latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680-type (46\\xa0mm diameter, 80\\xa0mm height) introduced in 2021. The battery was\\ndeveloped in-house by Tesla and is physically 5-times bigger than the 2170-type, again allowing for a higher capacity per\\ncell and a lower number of cells per battery pack.[181][182] Currently, Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed\\nthe cathode chemistry. The company has already opened production lines in Fremont, California, and plans to open lines\\ninside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas. The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at\\nGigafactory Texas.[173]\\n\\nPrismatic\\nTesla also uses prismatic (rectangular) cells in many entry-level Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.[173] The prismatic cells are\\na lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP or LiFePO4) which is a less energy-dense type, but do not contain any nickel or\\ncobalt, which makes it less expensive to produce.[183] Tesla sources these batteries from CATL\\'s factories in China. As of\\nApril 2022, nearly half of Tesla\\'s vehicle production used prismatic cells.[184] Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its\\nMegapack grid-scale energy storage product.[185]\\n\\nResearch\\nTesla invests in lithium-ion battery research. In 2016, the company established a 5-year battery research and development\\npartnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, with lead researcher Jeff Dahn.[186] Tesla acquired Maxwell\\nTechnologies for over $200 million[187] – and sold in 2021.[188] It also acquired Hibar Systems.[189][190] Tesla purchased\\nseveral battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International, a small Canadian battery\\ncompany.[191][192]\\n\\n\\n\\nLithium Refinement\\nIn 2023 Tesla broke ground on a $375 million lithium refining facility near Robstown, Texas in the US.[193] The plant\\'s\\nprocess will eliminate the use of sulfuric acid in lithium processing, thereby eliminating the associated sodium sulfate\\nwaste product.[193] Local concerns have been raised over the plant\\'s water usage with initial estimates of 400,000\\xa0US\\xa0gal\\n(1,500,000\\xa0 L; 330,000\\xa0 imp\\xa0 gal) per day for normal operation rising to a peak usage estimate of 8,000,000\\xa0 US\\xa0 gal\\n(30,000,000\\xa0L; 6,700,000\\xa0imp\\xa0gal) per day.[194]\\n\\nSoftware\\nTesla uses over-the-air updates to deliver updates to vehicles, adding features or fixing problems.[195] This is enabled by\\ntight integration between a few powerful onboard computers, compared to the way automakers had previously handled\\ntechnology, by purchasing off-the-shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the\\nsoftware level.[196]\\n\\nThe system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to. For example, for ease of assembly\\nall Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats, but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn\\nthem on. However, Tesla has allowed customers who didn\\'t pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear\\nseats.[197] Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full-Self Driving features, even though all\\nvehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features.[198]\\n\\nMotors\\nTesla makes two kinds of electric motors: an induction motor, and an internal permanent magnet (IPM) motor with\\nsynchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) characteristics.\\n\\nThe older design is a three-phase four-pole alternating current induction motor (also called an asynchronous motor) with a\\ncopper rotor (which inspired the Tesla logo).[199] These motors use electromagnetic induction, by varying magnetic field to\\nproduce torque. Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model\\n3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster.\\n\\nSince the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017, Tesla has also been building IPM-SynRM motors. These motors use an iron\\nrotor, with slots cut into the metal where magnets are inserted in the internal core. As an IPM motor, it produces excellent\\nstarting torque; however, performance declines at high speeds due to counter-electromotive forces. For high-speed\\noperation, Tesla engineers used iron\\'s reluctance property, which allows it to spin in synchronization with the magnetic\\nfield of the stator if channels are cut into the core. These channels were also an ideal internal location for the permanent\\nmagnets to be mounted.[200][201] The IPM-SynRM motor is currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y,\\nthe front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi.[202]\\n\\nNorth American Charging Standard\\nThe North American Charging Standard (NACS) is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla. It\\nhas been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since 2012 and was opened for use to other manufacturers in\\n2022. Since then, nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from 2025, their electric vehicles\\nsold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port. Several electric vehicles charging network operators\\nand equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors.[203]\\n\\n\"Autopilot\" and \"Full Self-Driving (Supervised)\"\\nTesla Autopilot is an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) developed by Tesla, Inc. that provides partial vehicle\\nautomation, corresponding to Level 2 automation as defined by SAE International. All Tesla vehicles produced after April\\n2019 include Autopilot,[204] which features autosteer and traffic-aware cruise control. Customers can purchase or subscribe\\nto an optional package called \"Full Self-Driving (Supervised)\", also known as \"FSD\", which adds features such as semi-\\nautonomous navigation, response to traffic lights and stop signs, lane change assistance, self-parking, and the ability to\\nsummon the car from a parking space.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 2013, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly predicted that the company\\nwould achieve fully autonomous driving (SAE Level 5) within one to three\\nyears,[205][206] but these goals have not been met. The branding of Full Self-\\nDriving has drawn criticism for potentially misleading consumers. Tesla\\nvehicles currently operate at Level 2 automation, which requires continuous\\ndriver supervision and does not constitute \"full\" self-driving capability.\\nPreviously, the Autopilot branding was also criticized for similar reasons,\\ndespite the fact that no current autopilot system in aircraft renders them fully\\nautonomous.[207]\\n\\nTesla claims that its driver-assistance features improve safety and reduce Tesla Autopilot in operation, 2017\\n\\naccidents caused by driver fatigue or inattention.[208][209] However, collisions\\nand fatalities involving Autopilot have attracted scrutiny from media and\\nregulators. Industry experts and safety advocates have raised concerns about the deployment of beta software to the general\\npublic, calling the practice risky and potentially irresponsible.[210][211][212][213][214]\\n\\nGlass\\nIn November 2016, the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the\\nTesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof\\'s solar shingles.[215]\\n\\nRobotics\\nIn preparation for Model 3 production, Tesla heavily invested in robotics and automation for vehicle assembly, and\\nbetween 2015 and 2017, the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including\\nCompass Automation,[216] Grohmann Automation,[217] Perbix Machine Company, and Riviera Tool and Die.[218] Musk\\nlater said that the robotics slowed production of the vehicles.[50]\\n\\nSubsequently, Tesla shifted towards using massive casting machines, known as Giga Presses. These machines streamline\\nproduction by creating large, single-piece underbodies, leading to reductions in production time, labor costs, factory\\nfootprint, and the number of welding robots.[219][220] Critics note that reducing the number of components makes the\\nvehicles harder or more expensive to repair after an accident.[221]\\n\\nThe company has been developing a humanoid robot called Optimus since 2022. Musk has stated that Optimus leverages\\nthe same core software powering Tesla\\'s Full Self-Driving technology and has suggested that it could be used within\\nTesla\\'s factories to mitigate labor shortages through the automation of repetitive tasks.[222]\\n\\nFacilities\\nThe company operates seven large factories and about a dozen smaller factories around the world. As of December\\xa02024,\\nthe company also operates more than 1,350 retail stores, galleries, service, delivery and body shop locations globally.[223]\\n\\n\\n\\nPrimary facilities operated by Tesla\\n\\nOpened Name City Country Employees Products Ref.\\n\\n2010 Tesla Fremont [31][224][225]\\nFactory Fremont, California United\\n\\nStates 22,000 Model\\xa0S, Model\\xa0X, Model\\xa03,\\nModel\\xa0Y\\n\\n2016 Gigafactory Storey County, United\\nNevada Nevada States 7,000 Batteries, Powerwall, Semi [226][227][228]\\n\\n2017 Gigafactory New\\nYork Buffalo, New York United\\n\\nStates 1,500 Solar\\xa0Roof, Supercharger [229][230]\\n\\n2019 Gigafactory\\nShanghai Shanghai China 20,000 Model\\xa03, Model\\xa0Y, [231][232]\\n\\nSupercharger\\n\\n2022 Gigafactory Berlin Grünheide Germany 10,000 Model\\xa0Y [233][234][235]\\n\\n2022 Gigafactory Texas Austin, Texas United\\nStates 12,000 Model\\xa0Y, Cybertruck [236][237][238]\\n\\nNorth America\\nTesla was founded in San Carlos, California, in 2003.[239] In 2008, the\\ncompany opened its first production facility at a former Chevrolet dealership in\\nMenlo Park, California. The original roadster was assembled inside the service\\nbays until 2012 and used the company showroom as a retail store.[240] Another\\nretail store was opened in Los Angeles the same year.[241] In 2010, Tesla\\nmoved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development\\nfacility in Palo Alto.[242]\\n\\nTesla\\'s first major assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in\\nFremont, California, known as the Tesla Fremont Factory. The factory was\\noriginally opened by General Motors in 1962, and then operated by NUMMI, a New Tesla Model S cars at the Tesla\\njoint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984.[243] The joint venture ended when Fremont Factory in 2012\\nGM entered bankruptcy in 2009. In 2010, Toyota agreed to sell the plant to\\nTesla at a significant discount.[31]\\n\\nTesla\\'s first purpose-built facility was opened in Nevada in 2016. Gigafactory\\nNevada produces the Powerwall,[226] battery cells in partnership with\\nPanasonic,[244] Model 3 drivetrains,[245] and the Tesla Semi.[246] The factory\\nreceived substantial subsidies (abatements and credits) from the local and state\\ngovernment, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla\\nto operate essentially tax-free for 10 years,[247] later extended to 20 years in\\nexchange for expanding the factory to add a production line for the Tesla Semi\\nand add additional battery manufacturing capacity.[246]\\n\\nGigafactory Nevada in 2019\\nAs part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla gained control of\\nGigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant.\\nThe state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the Buffalo Billion program.[248][249] In 2017, the\\nfactory started production of the Tesla Solar Roof,[229] but faced multiple production challenges. Since 2020, Tesla has\\nalso assembled Superchargers in New York. The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state\\nfunding.[250]\\n\\nIn 2018, Tesla assembled tension fabric buildings at the Fremont plant to meet production goals of 5,000 cars produced a\\nmonth.

Tesla were so incensed about what it considered unfair\\ncriticism (for example, the test affirmed that in the performance tests they ran the battery charge would have lasted for 55\\nmiles, a figure that actually came from Tesla. Tesla said that the figure was untrue and libellous as the car\\'s mileage in\\nnormal use was claimed to be 211) that they sued, and lost.[311][312]\\n\\nIn 2025, when Tesla was the subject of protests and vandalism in response to Elon Musk\\'s political activities with the\\nTrump government, former Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson published gloating remarks, saying that the vandalism\\nwas \"not funny.

Especially if you\\'re me.\"[313]\\n\\nSexual harassment\\nIn 2021, seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at\\nTesla\\'s Fremont factory.[314] They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment. The women\\nsaid they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, unwanted touching, and discrimination while at\\nwork. \"I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just\\nso I could get some relief,\" Brooks told The Washington Post. \"That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my\\njob.\" Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex.[315]\\n\\nWomen feared calling Human Resources for help, as their supervisors were often participants.[316] Musk himself is not\\nindicted, but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk.\\nThey cite his crude remarks about women\\'s bodies, wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to \"T.IT.S\", and\\nhis generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment.[317] \"What we\\'re addressing for each of the lawsuits\\n\\n\\n\\nis just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla,\" said attorney David A. Lowe.[316] In 2017, another\\nwoman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired. In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla\\nconfirmed the company had terminated her employment, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee\\'s allegations\\nwith the help of \"a neutral, third-party expert\" and concluded her complaints were unmerited.[318]\\n\\nIn May 2022, a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court, rejecting Tesla\\'s request for\\nclosed-door arbitration.[319]\\n\\nLabor disputes\\nTesla has had labor disputes in the United States, Germany and Sweden,\\nincluding an ongoing strike in Sweden. Tesla, Inc., an American electric car\\nand solar panel manufacturer, has more than 140,000 workers employed across\\nits global operations as of January 2024.[320] Tesla CEO Elon Musk has\\nexpressed his opposition to unions on Twitter (now called X). The National\\nLabor Relations Board held that one tweet was unlawful, but was overturned\\nby a federal appeals court.[321] All unionization efforts at the Tesla Fremont\\nFactory and Gigafactory New York in the United States have been\\nunsuccessful.[322] In Germany, Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Tesla\\nAutomation have elected works councils, but they have not signed collective\\nbargaining agreements with the German trade union IG Metall.[323][324] The\\nGigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg works council is divided into pro-union and\\nanti-union factions.[325] In Sweden, mechanics who are members of the trade\\nunion IF Metall have been on strike since October 27, 2023, making it the\\nlongest strike in Sweden since 1938.[326] The strike has since spread, with\\nother Swedish, Danish and Norwegian unions calling for solidarity strikes.[327]\\n\\nAccidents, repairs and safety violations\\nValentine\\'s Day union drive at Giga New\\n\\nIn June 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) York in 2023\\ntook issue with Tesla\\'s use of nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) regarding\\ncustomer repairs[328] and, in October 2021, the NHTSA formally asked Tesla\\nto explain its NDA policy regarding customers invited into the FSD Beta.[329] Tesla has used NDAs on multiple occasions\\nwith both employees[330] and customers[331] to allegedly prevent possible negative coverage.[332][333]\\n\\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Tesla\\'s Fremont Factory had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration\\n(OSHA) violations as the ten largest U.S. auto plants combined.[334] An investigation by the Reveal podcast alleged that\\nTesla \"failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports\" to downplay the extent of injuries.[335]\\n\\nIn January 2019, former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company\\nhad hacked employees\\' phones and spied on them, while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and\\nshareholders.[336][337][338] Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla. These\\ninclude the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez[339][340] and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen.[341] In\\n2020, the court ordered Hansen\\'s case to arbitration.[342] In June 2022, the arbitrator filed an unopposed motion with the\\ncourt stating Hansen \"has failed to establish the claims… Accordingly, his claims are denied, and he shall take\\nnothing\".[343]\\n\\nThe California Civil Rights Department filed a suit in 2022 alleging \"a pattern of racial harassment and bias\" at the Tesla\\nFremont factory. As of April 2023, the department is also conducting a probe of the factory based on a 2021 complaint and\\nclaims that Tesla has been obstructing the investigation.[344]\\n\\nAccording to Jalopnik, a 2024 study by iSeeCars found that Tesla had the highest fatal crash rate of any automaker in the\\nUnited States.[345]\\n\\nA 2025 lawsuit in California alleged that Tesla odometers were falsely exaggerating their readings to prematurely void\\ntheir warranty.[346]\\n\\n\\n\\nFraud allegations\\nThere have been numerous concerns about Tesla\\'s financial reporting. In 2013, Bloomberg News questioned whether\\nTesla\\'s financial reporting violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) reporting standards.[347] Fortune\\naccused Tesla in 2016 of using creative accounting to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits.[348] In 2018, analysts\\nexpressed concerns over Tesla\\'s accounts receivable balance.[349] In September 2019, the SEC questioned Tesla CFO Zach\\nKirkhorn about Tesla\\'s warranty reserves and lease accounting.[350] In a letter to his clients, hedge fund manager David\\nEinhorn, whose firm suffered losses from its short position against Tesla that quarter, accused Elon Musk in November\\n2019 of \"significant fraud\",[351][352] and publicly questioned Tesla\\'s accounting practices, telling Musk that he was\\n\"beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist.\"[353]\\n\\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than $295\\xa0 million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a battery-swapping\\ntechnology that was never made available to customers.[354] Staff at California Air Resources Board were concerned that\\nTesla was \"gaming\" the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits.[355]\\n\\nA consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition, that he and\\nthe Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection\\nwith the deal, and failed to disclose \"troubling facts\" essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition.[356] The members\\nof the board settled in 2020, leaving Musk as the only defendant.[357] In April 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled\\nin favor of Musk,[358][359] and its ruling was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in June 2023.[360]\\n\\nIn August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\"[361] The tweet\\ncaused the stock to initially rise, but then drop when it was revealed to be false.[362][363][364] Musk settled fraud charges\\nwith the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his false statements in September 2018. According to the\\nterms of the settlement, Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla\\'s in-house counsel, he was removed from his\\nchairman role at Tesla temporarily, and two new independent directors were appointed to the company\\'s board.[365] Tesla\\nand Musk also paid civil penalties of $20\\xa0million each.[365] A civil class-action shareholder lawsuit over Musk\\'s statements\\nand other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Tesla\\'s board of directors, as then\\nconstituted, regarding claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private.[366][367] In February\\n2023, a California jury unanimously found Musk and Tesla not liable in the class-action lawsuit.[368]\\n\\nIn September 2018, Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\\nregarding its Model 3 production figures.[369] Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and\\nmade projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet.[369] A stockholder class action\\nlawsuit against Tesla related to Model 3 production numbers (unrelated to the FBI investigation) was dismissed in March\\n2019.[370][371][372]\\n\\nIn May 2024, Reuters reported that US federal prosecutors were investigating whether the company committed securities\\nor wire fraud by \"misleading investors and consumers\" about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.[373]\\n\\nTesla US dealership disputes\\nUnlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles and instead directly sells\\nvehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. In some areas, Tesla operates locations called\\n\"galleries\" which \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale\\nof vehicles.\"[158] This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from\\ndirectly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These\\nassociations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete, lowering the price a\\ncustomer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their dealers.[161] The United\\nStates Federal Trade Commission ultimately disproved the associations\\' claims and recommended allowing direct\\nmanufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[374][375][376]\\n\\nTesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars.[377] The company has argued that directly\\noperating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles,[158] because dealerships would sell both Tesla and\\ngas-powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since\\nproperly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas-powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to\\n\\n\\n\\ndealership EV sales.[161] Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles\\nbecause they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after-sales service revenue, a large profit center for most\\ndealerships.[129]\\n\\nIntellectual property\\nTesla has sued former employees for stealing company information, including those who left to work for a rival such as\\nXPeng and Zoox.[378] For example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading Tesla Autopilot source code\\nto his iCloud account,[379] and Alex Khatilov was accused of downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his\\npersonal Dropbox account.[380]\\n\\nMisappropriation\\nIn 2018, a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla\\'s board alleging they breached their fiduciary\\nduties by approving Musk\\'s stock-based compensation plan.[367] Musk received the first portion of his stock options\\npayout, worth more than $700\\xa0million in May 2020.[381]\\n\\nIn July 2023, Tesla board members returned $735 million to the company to settle a claim from a 2020 lawsuit alleging\\nmisappropriation of 11 million stock options granted to Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Larry Ellison, and others from 2017 to\\n2020.[382]\\n\\nEnvironmental violations\\nIn 2019, The United States Environmental Protection Agency fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in\\n2017.[383] In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the Bay Area Air Quality\\nManagement District;[384] the violations took place around Tesla Fremont\\'s paint shop, where there had been at least four\\nfires between 2014 and 2019.[385] Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla\\'s Fremont Factory increased\\nfrom 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3.[386]\\n\\nIn June 2018, Tesla employee Martin Tripp leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40% of its raw\\nmaterials at the Nevada Gigafactory.[387] After Tesla fired him for the leak, Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Tesla\\'s\\nsecurity team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory.[388][336] The court ruled in\\nTesla\\'s favor on September 17, 2020.[389][390]\\n\\nIn January 2024, 25 California counties sued Tesla, accusing the company of violating state health and safety codes by\\nillegally disposing of hazardous waste. Later that week, the case was settled on the conditions that Tesla pay US$1.5\\nmillion and admit to acting \"intentionally\" and \"negligent\". Moreover, Tesla also agreed to train its employees on\\nhazardous waste disposal and to have 10 percent of Tesla\\'s facilities audited for waste disposal for the next 5\\nyears.[391][392][393]\\n\\nProperty damage\\nIn August 2019, Walmart filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that Tesla\\'s \"negligent installation and\\nmaintenance\" of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012.[394] Walmart reached a\\nsettlement with Tesla in November 2019; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[395]\\n\\nIn April 2021, a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 over-the-air software\\nupdate, after they failed to respond to the lawsuit. The 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit were awarded 136,000\\nNorwegian kroner each ($16,000).[396][397]\\n\\nRacism\\nTesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination,[398][399] with one former\\nTesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as \"a hotbed of racist behavior.\"[400] As of December 2021,\\nthree percent of leadership at the company were African-American.[401] A former Black worker described the work\\n\\n\\n\\nenvironment at Tesla\\'s Buffalo plant as a \"very racist place.\"[402] Tesla and SpaceX\\'s treatment of Juneteenth in 2020 also\\ncame under fire.[403] Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that the company\\ndiscriminates specifically against African Americans and \"allows a racist environment in its factories.\"[404]\\n\\nFew of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements.[405]\\n\\nEmployees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court, and behind closed doors.\\n\\nFremont, California, plant\\nAccording to the state\\'s Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place\\nwhere Black employees claim they are given the most menial[398] and physically demanding work.[406] The accusations of\\nracism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for\\n\"discriminating against its Black workers.\"[407]\\n\\nIn July 2021, former employee Melvin Berry received $1\\xa0 million in his discrimination case in arbitration against the\\ncompany after he claimed he was referred to by the n-word and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant.[408]\\n\\nIn October 2021, a jury verdict in the Owen Diaz vs. Tesla trial awarded the plaintiff $137\\xa0million in damages after he had\\nfaced racial harassment at Tesla\\'s Fremont facility during 2015–2016.[409][410] In a blog, Tesla stressed that Diaz was never\\n\"really\" a Tesla worker, and that most uttering of the n-word were expressed in a friendly manner.[411][412] In April 2022,\\nfederal judge William Orrick upheld the jury finding of Tesla\\'s liability but reduced the total damage down to\\n$15\\xa0 million.[413] Diaz was given a two-week deadline to decide if he would collect the damages.

In an earnings call in April, he was heard calling the public health orders \"fascist\".[416] He had also called the\\npublic\\'s response to the pandemic \"dumb\" and had said online that there would be zero cases by April.[417] In May 2020,\\nwhile Alameda County officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont Factory on the 18th, Musk\\ndefied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th.[418][419][420] Tesla also sued Alameda County,\\nquestioning the legality of the orders, but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen.[421][422] In\\nJune 2020, Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe,[423] however some\\nemployees still expressed concern for their health.[424]\\n\\nIn May 2020, Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work.[425] But in\\nJune, Tesla dismissed an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers\\nfrom the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory.[426] Three more employees at Tesla\\'s Fremont Factory claimed they were laid\\noff for staying home out of fear of catching COVID-19. This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the\\nemployees were still on the payroll.[427] COVID-19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December\\n2020, with about 450 total cases in that time out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant (4.5%).[416][428]\\n\\nIn China, Tesla had what one executive described as \"not a green light from the government to get back to work\\xa0– but a\\nflashing-sirens police escort.\"[429] Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China, including tax\\nbreaks, cheap financing, and assistance in building its Giga Shanghai factory at breakneck speeds.[429] Musk has praised\\nChina\\'s way of doing things, a controversial stance due to deteriorating U.S.–Chinese relations, the Persecution of Uyghurs\\nin China, and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong.[429]\\n\\nRight to repair\\nIn March 2023, a class action antitrust lawsuit was filed against Tesla by Virginia M.

As of the date of publication, the Associated Press reported that Tesla had won 11 verdicts,\\ntwo judgments were on appeal, and one had been settled outside court.[436]\\n\\nCriticism\\n\\nData privacy\\nA Tesla vehicle was only the second product ever reviewed by the Mozilla Foundation that failed all of their privacy\\ncriteria.[437][438]\\n\\nA Tesla owner filed a lawsuit in 2023 following a Reuters report that Tesla employees shared \"highly invasive videos and\\nimages recorded by customers\\' car cameras\" with one another.[439]\\n\\nInternal data troves shared with various international government agencies and news organizations by former employee\\nand whistleblower Lukasz Krupski in late 2023 implicated Tesla in \"serious data protection lapse[s].\"[440] The data\\nKrupski retrieved included \"information about current and former Tesla staff, including passport numbers, medical details\\nand salaries\" and was readily available on internal systems that most employees had access to.[441] As of November 2023,\\nthe Data Protection Authority in the Netherlands was investigating whether Tesla\\'s alleged lack of internal security violated\\nprivacy laws.[442]\\n\\nShort sellers\\nTSLAQ is a collective of Tesla skeptics and short-sellers who are vocally critically of Tesla and aim to \"shape [the]\\nperception [of Tesla] and move its stock.\"[443] In January 2020, 20% of Tesla stock was shorted, the highest at that time of\\nany stock in the U.S. equity markets.[444] By early 2021, according to CNN, short sellers had lost $40\\xa0billion during 2020\\nas the stock price climbed much higher.[445] Michael Burry, a short seller portrayed in The Big Short, had shorted Tesla\\npreviously via his firm Scion Asset Management, but removed his position in October 2021.[446]\\n\\nTesla\\'s mission\\nAccording to automotive journalist Jamie Kitman, when multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers approached\\nTesla for EV technology that Musk had claimed the company was willing to share, they instead were offered the\\nopportunity to buy regulatory credits from the company. This suggested, according to Kitman, that \"the company may not\\n\\n\\n\\nbe as eager for the electric revolution to occur as it claims.\"[447]\\n\\nGiga New York audit\\nIn 2020, the New York State Comptroller released an audit of the Giga New York factory project, concluding that it\\npresented many red flags, including lack of basic due diligence and that the factory itself produced only $0.54 in economic\\nbenefits for every $1 spent by the state.[448][449][450]\\n\\nDelays\\nMusk has been criticized for repeated pushing out both production and release dates of products.[451][452] By one count in\\n2016, Musk had missed 20 projections.[453] In October 2017, Musk predicted that Model 3 production would be 5,000\\nunits per week by December.[454] A month later, he revised that target to \"sometime in March\" 2018.[455] Delivery dates\\nfor the Model 3 were delayed as well.[456] Other projects like converting supercharger stations to be solar-powered have\\nalso lagged projections.[457] Musk responded in late 2018: \"punctuality is not my strong suit...I never made a mass-\\nproduced car. How am I supposed to know with precision when it\\'s gonna get done?\"[458]\\n\\nVehicle product issues\\n\\nRecalls\\nOn April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty\\nparking brakes which could become stuck and \"prevent the vehicles from moving\".[459][460] On March 29, 2018, Tesla\\nissued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to corrosion-susceptible power steering\\nbolts, which could fail and require the driver to use \"increased force\" to control the vehicle.[461]\\n\\nIn October 2020, Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50,000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China for suspension\\nissues.[462] Soon after in November, the NHTSA announced it had opened its investigation into 115,000 Tesla cars\\nregarding \"front suspension safety issues\", citing specifically 2015–2017 Model S and 2016–2017 Model X years. Cases of\\nthe \"whompy wheel\" phenomenon, which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars, have been documented\\nthrough 2020.[463][464]\\n\\nIn February 2021, Tesla was required by the NHTSA to recall 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles built from 2012 to\\n2018 due to using a flash memory device that was rated to last only 5 to 6 years.[465] The problem was related to\\ntouchscreen failures that could possibly affect the rearview camera, safety systems, Autopilot and other features.[466][467]\\n\\nThe underlying technical reason is that the car writes a large amount of syslog content to the device, wearing it out\\nprematurely.[468]\\n\\nAlso in February 2021, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) ordered Tesla to recall 12,300 Model X cars\\nbecause of \"body mouldings problems\".[469][470]\\n\\nIn June 2021, Tesla recalled 5,974 electric vehicles due to worries that brake caliper bolts might become loose, which\\ncould lead to loss of tire pressure, increasing the chance of a crash.[471]\\n\\nOn December 30, 2021, Tesla announced that they are recalling more than 475,000 US model vehicles. This included\\n356,309 Model 3 Tesla vehicles from 2017 to 2020 due to rear-view camera issues and a further 119,009 Tesla Model S\\nvehicles due to potential problems with the trunk or boot. The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between\\n2014 and 2021. Around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera, and around 14% of recalled\\nmodel S\\' may have the defect. The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the \"Passenger Play\"\\nfeature, which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion.[472] After an investigation was\\nlaunched by the NHTSA covering 585,000 vehicles, Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and\\nunusable while the car is moving.[473]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn September 2022, Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 1.1\\xa0million US model vehicles because the automatic\\nwindow reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury.[474][475] In\\nresponse,} Tesla announced an over-the-air software fix.[475]\\n\\nIn February 2023, Tesla recalled its FSD software following a recommendation from NHTSA; the recall applied to\\napproximately 360,000 cars.[476] NHTSA found that FSD caused \"unreasonable risk\" when used on city streets.[477] In\\nMarch 2023, about 3,500 Model Y Teslas were recalled for a bolting issue concerning the cars\\' second-row seats.[478]\\n\\nIn December 2023, following a 2-year investigation by the NHTSA,[479] Tesla issued a wider recall on all vehicles\\nequipped with any version of Autosteer, including 2012–2023 Model S; 2016–2023 Model X; 2017–2023 Model 3; and\\n2020–2023 Model Y, covering 2,031,220 vehicles in total.[480] The NHTSA concluded that Autosteer\\'s controls were not\\nsufficient to prevent misuse and did not ensure that the drivers maintained \"continuous and sustained responsibility for\\nvehicle operation\" and states that affected vehicles will receive an over-the-air software remedy.[480][481]\\n\\nFires\\nTesla customers have reported the company as being \"slow\" to address how their cars can ignite.[482] In 2013, a Model S\\ncaught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the\\nbattery pack and was caused by the impact of an object.[483] As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its\\ndecision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[484] In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had\\nclosed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection\\nto its battery packs.[485] All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25-inch (6.4\\xa0mm) aluminum\\nshield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[486] In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an\\ninvestigation into possible battery defects in Tesla\\'s Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause \"non-\\ncrash\" fires.[487][488][489]\\n\\nAutopilot crashes\\nA Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is\\nbelieved to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot.[490][491] The NHTSA investigated the accident\\nbut found no safety-related defect trend.[492] In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash.\\nInvestigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in \\'self-driving\\' mode and was using his phone to play games\\nwhen the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the\\nTesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.[493]\\n\\nAccording to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that\\nwere believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities.[494][495] In early September 2021, the\\nNHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident[496] and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data\\npertaining to US cars with Autopilot to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-\\nresponder vehicles.[496][497][498] In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect\\nemergency lights at night.[499] In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it did not issue a recall when it sent out that\\nupdate.[500] In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla\\nmodels. The probe was moved up from the Preliminary Evaluation level to Engineering Analysis. The regulator cited the\\nreason for the expansion as the need to \"explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may\\nexacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver\\'s supervision.\"[501]\\n\\nA safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full\\nSelf-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[502] but there has been controversy over its\\nconclusions.[503] Several Tesla owners responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA\\nreleased a statement warning against the practice.[504]\\n\\nIn 2025, the California DMV filed a lawsuit against Tesla, claiming they had misled drivers about its vehicles\\' self-driving\\ncapabilities. The DMV sought to suspend Tesla\\'s sales and manufacturing in the state of California for a minimum of 30\\ndays.[505][506]\\n\\n\\n\\nSoftware hacking\\nIn August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car\\'s\\nentertainment system.[507] The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[508] Tesla issued a security\\nupdate for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.[509]\\n\\nIn September 2016, researchers at Tencent\\'s Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and\\ncontrolled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the\\nautomotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle\\'s web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a\\nmalicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[510] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability\\nwas disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made\\npublic.[511] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[512]\\n\\nIn January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed\\ndirectly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing\\nthe compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the\\ncompromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[513][514] Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car\\nand $375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event.[515]\\n\\nIn June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier\\nto start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their keys to a\\nvehicle.[516]\\n\\nPhantom braking\\nIn February 2022, Tesla drivers have reported a surge in \"phantom braking\" events when using Tesla Autopilot which\\ncoincides with the automaker\\'s removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021.[517] In response, NHTSA opened\\nan investigation the same month.[518] In August 2022, a consumer class action was filed alleging that the Autopilot system\\nin Tesla cars \"contains a hazardous defect which causes the vehicle to suddenly and unintentionally brake\".[519][520] In\\nNovember 2024, Tesla failed to persuade a U.S. District Judge to dismiss the lawsuit.[521] The next court date is January 7,\\n2025.[521]\\n\\nIn May 2023, German business newspaper Handelsblatt published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla\\ndata submitted to them from informants.[522] The 100 gigabytes of data \"contain[ed] over 1,000 accident reports involving\\nphantom braking or unintended acceleration\" as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot.[523] Dutch authorities responded\\nby saying they were investigating the company for possible data privacy violations.[524]\\n\\nIn February 2025, a German court declared Tesla Autopilot as defective for normal use due to phantom braking issues.[525]\\n\\nIn February 2025, a group of Australian buyers sued Tesla with a class action over multiple issues like battery range,\\ndriving assistance and phantom braking.[526]\\n\\nDriving range performance\\nTesla has received thousands of complaints from owners that the driving ranges of their vehicles did not meet the ranges\\nadvertised by Tesla or the projections of in-dash range meters. When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments\\nto take care of these issues, Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible. Customers were\\ntold that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem and their appointments were canceled. The company has\\nbeen fined by South Korean regulators for its exaggerated range estimates.[527]\\n\\nVehicle sales\\nIn 2024, Tesla ranked as the world\\'s best-selling battery electric passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of\\n17.6%.[528] Tesla reported 2023 vehicle deliveries of 1.8 million units, up 38% from 2022.[529][530] In March 2024, Tesla\\nproduced its six millionth car.[531] In Q4 2023, BYD took over the top spot for EVs shipped, but Tesla regained the title in\\n\\n\\n\\nQ1 2024.[532]\\n\\nTesla sells the most vehicles in the US (674,000+ in 2023) and has received $11.4 billion in regulatory credits from federal\\nand state governments. The federal government previously provided a $7500 rebate to customers.[533][534][535] Tesla\\nreceived around $426 million from the Chinese government for cars manufactured at its Shanghai facility.[536] Germany\\nwas Tesla\\'s third largest market in 2023, selling 63,682 units. Germany ended its EV subsidy program in December 2023.\\nUnder the program, a €6,750 discount was provided with Tesla paying €2,250. Tesla announced it would cover the entire\\ndiscount going forward.[537] In 2023, over 63,000 Teslas were sold in France with customers receiving up to €7,000 via the\\nbonus écologique. The government decreased the budget for EV aid from €1.5 billion to €700 million in 2024.[538] Canada\\nwas in Tesla\\'s top five markets in 2023 with over 52,000 vehicles sold. In 2025, Tesla was accused of having \"a run on the\\nbank\" when it sold an historic 8,600 vehicles in 72 hours before Canada\\'s EV rebate program\\'s funds were depleted. Tesla\\nclaimed 4000 vehicles alone were sold over one weekend in Quebec City.[539][540] The Government of Canada announced\\non March 25, 2025, that it had suspended the rebates and was investigating. The government also declared Tesla would be\\nineligible for any future rebates as long as the US tariffs on Canadian products continued.[541] Elon Musk has stated he is\\nagainst government subsidies but will take them if they are available.[542]\\n\\nSales have been negatively impacted by Elon Musk\\'s actions during the second Trump presidency.[543][544] Tesla sales\\nhave decreased worldwide (the most in countries like France, Germany, the UK, Sweden, Norway, and the\\nNetherlands)[545][546] with his vocal support for far-right parties such as Reform UK[547] and AfD[548] in Germany along\\nwith his Nazi salute controversy leading to boycotts of his products and Tesla vehicles being nicknamed Swasticars.[554]\\n\\nGerman sales fell 76% in February 2025 compared to February 2024.[555][556]\\n\\nTesla\\'s shares dropped over 9 percent after its sales in the EU and UK declined by nearly half in January 2025, bringing its\\nvaluation below $1 trillion for the first time since November 2024. While European electric car sales surged, Tesla\\nstruggled against rising competition, particularly from Chinese automakers.[557] In May 2025, it was reported that the\\ncompany\\'s sales in Europe declined every month since the start of the year, including in April where sales dropped 49\\npercent to 7,261 from 14,228 in April 2024.[558] As of May 2025, the company has a 0.7 percent market share in Europe,\\ndown from 1.3 percent a year ago.[558]\\n\\nProduction and sales by quarter\\n\\n600,000\\n\\n500,000\\n\\n400,000\\n\\n300,000\\n\\n200,000\\n\\n100,000\\n\\n3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2\\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\\n\\n\\xa0  Model S \\xa0  Model S/X \\xa0  Model 3\\n\\xa0  Model X \\xa0  Models Other Than 3/Y \\xa0  Model 3/Y\\n\\nTesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as availability of car carriers and registration. On\\nMarch 9, 2020, the company produced its 1\\xa0millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a\\nmilestone.[559] In the third quarter of 2021, Tesla sold its 2 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to\\nachieve such a milestone.[560] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y became the world\\'s best-selling car, surpassing the\\nToyota Corolla.[561]\\n\\n\\n\\nFinances\\nFor the fiscal (and calendar) year 2021, Tesla\\nreported a net income of $5.52\\xa0billion.[562] The Tesla financial performance\\n\\nannual revenue was $53.8\\xa0 billion, an increase\\nof 71% over the previous fiscal year.[562]\\n\\nOf the revenue number in 2021, $314\\xa0 million came from Sales by business (2024)[563]\\n\\nselling regulatory credits to other automakers to meet\\nBusiness Sales in billion $ Share\\n\\ngovernment pollution standards.
